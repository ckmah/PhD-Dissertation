\subsection{Experimental model and subject details}
\subsubsection{Tunicates}
Adult \textit{\textit{Ciona} intestinalis type A}, also known as \textit{\textit{Ciona} robusta}, were obtained from M-Rep and were maintained under constant illumination in seawater (obtained from Reliant Aquariums) at $18^\circ$C. \textit{Ciona} are hermaphroditic, therefore there is only one possible sex for individuals. Age or developmental stage of the embryos studied are indicated in the main text.
