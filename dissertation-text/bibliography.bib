Here we report completion of the project, having reconstructed the genomes of 2,504 individuals from 26 populations using a combination of low-coverage whole-genome sequencing, deep exome sequencing, and dense microarray genotyping. We characterized a broad spectrum of genetic variation, in total over 88 million variants (84.7 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 3.6 million short insertions/deletions (indels), and 60,000 structural variants), all phased onto high-quality haplotypes. This resource includes {$>$}99\% of SNP variants with a frequency of {$>$}1\% for a variety of ancestries. We describe the distribution of genetic variation across the global sample, and discuss the implications for common disease studies.},

Here we present results of the pilot phase of the project, designed to develop and compare different strategies for genome-wide sequencing with high-throughput platforms. We undertook three projects: low-coverage whole-genome sequencing of 179 individuals from four populations; high-coverage sequencing of two mother-father-child trios; and exon-targeted sequencing of 697 individuals from seven populations. We describe the location, allele frequency and local haplotype structure of approximately 15 million single nucleotide polymorphisms, 1 million short insertions and deletions, and 20,000 structural variants, most of which were previously undescribed. We show that, because we have catalogued the vast majority of common variation, over 95\% of the currently accessible variants found in any individual are present in this data set. On average, each person is found to carry approximately 250 to 300 loss-of-function variants in annotated genes and 50 to 100 variants previously implicated in inherited disorders. We demonstrate how these results can be used to inform association and functional studies. From the two trios, we directly estimate the rate of de novo germline base substitution mutations to be approximately 10(-8) per base pair per generation. We explore the data with regard to signatures of natural selection, and identify a marked reduction of genetic variation in the neighbourhood of genes, due to selection at linked sites. These methods and public data will support the next phase of human genetic research.},

  abstract = {Background:\hspace{0.6em} Degradation rate is a fundamental aspect of mRNA metabolism, and the factors governing it remain poorly characterized. Understanding the genetic and biochemical determinants of mRNA half-life would enable more precise identification of variants that perturb gene expression through post-transcriptional gene regulatory mechanisms. Results:\hspace{0.6em} We establish a compendium of 39 human and 27 mouse transcriptome-wide mRNA decay rate datasets. A meta-analysis of these data identified a prevalence of technical noise and measurement bias, induced partially by the underlying experimental strategy. Correcting for these biases allowed us to derive more precise, consensus measurements of half-life which exhibit enhanced consistency between species. We trained substantially improved statistical models based upon genetic and biochemical features to better predict half-life and characterize the factors molding it. Our stateof-the-art model, Saluki, is a hybrid convolutional and recurrent deep neural network which relies only upon an mRNA sequence annotated with coding frame and splice sites to predict half-life (r=0.77). The key novel principle learned by Saluki is that the spatial positioning of splice sites, codons, and RNA-binding motifs within an mRNA is strongly associated with mRNA half-life. Saluki predicts the impact of RNA sequences and genetic mutations therein on mRNA stability, in agreement with functional measurements derived from massively parallel reporter assays. Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} Our work produces a more robust ground truth for transcriptome-wide mRNA half-lives in mammalian cells. Using these revised measurements, we trained Saluki, a model that is over 50\% more accurate in predicting half-life from sequence than existing models. Saluki succinctly captures many of the known determinants of mRNA half-life and can be rapidly deployed to predict the functional consequences of arbitrary mutations in the transcriptome.},

Surprisingly, a model that includes only promoter sequences and features associated with mRNA stability explains 59\% and 71\% of variation in steady-state mRNA levels in human and mouse, respectively. This model, termed Xpresso, more than doubles the accuracy of alternative sequence-based models and isolates rules as predictive as models relying on chromatic immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data. Xpresso recapitulates genome-wide patterns of transcriptional activity, and its residuals can be used to quantify the influence of enhancers, heterochromatic domains, and microRNAs. Model interpretation reveals that promoter-proximal CpG dinucleotides strongly predict transcriptional activity. Looking forward, we propose cell-type-specific gene-expression predictions based solely on primary sequences as a grand challenge for the field.},

Injected mRNA initially appears dispersed in the perikaryon. Within minutes, the RNA forms granules which, in the case of MBP mRNA, are transported down the processes to the periphery of the cell where the distribution again becomes dispersed. In situ hybridization shows that endogenous MBP mRNA in oligodendrocytes also appears as granules in the perikaryon and processes and dispersed in the peripheral membranes. The granules are not released by extraction with non-ionic detergent, indicating that they are associated with the cytoskeletal matrix. Three dimensional visualization indicates that MBP mRNA granules are often aligned in tracks along microtubules traversing the cytoplasm and processes. Several distinct patterns of granule movement are observed. Granules in the processes undergo sustained directional movement with a velocity of approximately 0.2 micron/s. Granules at branch points undergo oscillatory motion with a mean displacement of 0.1 micron/s. Granules in the periphery of the cell circulate randomly with a mean displacement of approximately 1 micron/s. The results are discussed in terms of a multi-step pathway for transport and localization of MBP mRNA in oligodendrocytes. This work represents the first characterization of intracellular movement of mRNA in living cells, and the first description of the role of RNA granules in transport and localization of mRNA in cells.},

Given the recent advances in light microscopy and the need for accurate and high-throughput analysis of cells, automated algorithms have been developed for segmenting and analyzing the cells in microscopy images. Nevertheless, accurate, generic and robust whole-cell segmentation is still a persisting need to precisely quantify its morphological properties, phenotypes and sub-cellular dynamics. RESULTS: We present a single-channel whole cell segmentation algorithm. We use markers that stain the whole cell, but with less staining in the nucleus, and without using a separate nuclear stain. We show the utility of our approach in microscopy images of cell cultures in a wide variety of conditions. Our algorithm uses a deep learning approach to learn and predict locations of the cells and their nuclei, and combines that with thresholding and watershed-based segmentation. We trained and validated our approach using different sets of images, containing cells stained with various markers and imaged at different magnifications. Our approach achieved a 86\% similarity to ground truth segmentation when identifying and separating cells. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed algorithm is able to automatically segment cells from single channel images using a variety of markers and magnifications.},

We call this approach DeepBind and have built a stand-alone software tool that is fully automatic and handles millions of sequences per experiment.

Immunotherapies such as those that target immune checkpoint molecules can be used to augment immune-mediated elimination of tumours and have resulted in durable responses in patients with cancer that did not respond to previous treatments. However, only a subset of patients benefit from immunotherapy and more knowledge about what is required for successful treatment is needed2-4. Although the role of tumour neoantigen-specific CD8+ T cells in tumour rejection is well established5-9, the roles of other subsets of T cells have received less attention. Here we show that spontaneous and immunotherapy-induced anti-tumour responses require the activity of both tumour-antigen-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, even in tumours that do not express major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules. In addition, the expression of MHC class II-restricted antigens by tumour cells is required at the site of successful rejection, indicating that activation of CD4+ T cells must also occur in the tumour microenvironment. These findings suggest that MHC class II-restricted neoantigens have a key function in the anti-tumour response that is nonoverlapping with that of MHC class I-restricted neoantigens and therefore needs to be considered when identifying patients who will most benefit from immunotherapy.},

  abstract = {Cell interactions determine phenotypes, and intercellular communication is shaped by cellular contexts such as disease state, organismal life stage, and tissue microenvironment. Single-cell technologies measure the molecules mediating cell-cell communication, and emerging computational tools can exploit these data to decipher intercellular communication. However, current methods either disregard cellular context or rely on simple pairwise comparisons between samples, thus limiting the ability to decipher complex cell-cell communication across multiple time points, levels of disease severity, or spatial contexts. Here we present Tensor-cell2cell, an unsupervised method using tensor decomposition, which is the first strategy to decipher context-driven intercellular communication by simultaneously accounting for multiple stages, states, or locations of the cells. To do so, Tensor-cell2cell uncovers context-driven patterns of communication associated with different phenotypic states and determined by unique combinations of cell types and ligand-receptor pairs. We show Tensor-cell2cell can identify multiple modules associated with distinct communication processes (e.g., participating cell-cell and ligand receptor pairs) linked to COVID-19 severities. Thus, we introduce an effective and easy-to-use strategy for understanding complex communication patterns across diverse conditions.},

While these methods are increasingly accessible, computational approaches for studying the interplay of the spatial structure of tissues and cell-cell heterogeneity are only beginning to emerge. Here, we present spatial variance component analysis (SVCA), a computational framework for the analysis of spatial molecular data. SVCA enables quantifying different dimensions of spatial variation and in particular quantifies the effect of cell-cell interactions on gene expression. In a breast cancer Imaging Mass Cytometry dataset, our model yields interpretable spatial variance signatures, which reveal cell-cell interactions as a major driver of protein expression heterogeneity. Applied to high-dimensional imaging-derived RNA data, SVCA identifies plausible gene families that are linked to cell-cell interactions. SVCA is available as a free software tool that can be widely applied to spatial data from different technologies.},

A particularly robust and broadly applicable method is immunofluorescence microscopy, in which a specific fluorescently labeled antibody binds the molecule of interest and then the location of the antibody is determined by fluorescence microscopy. The effective application of this technique includes several considerations, including the nature of the antigen, specificity of the antibody, permeabilization and fixation of the specimen, and fluorescence imaging of the cell. Although each protocol will require fine-tuning depending on the cell type, the antibody, and the antigen, there are steps common to nearly all applications. This unit provides protocols for visualization of the cytoskeleton in two very different kinds of cells: flat, adherent fibroblasts and thick, free-swimming Tetrahymena cells. ? 2015 by John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.}

  abstract = {The primary cardiotoxic action of doxorubicin when used as antitumor drug is attributed to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) therefore effective cardioprotection therapies are needed. In this sense, the antianginal drug nicorandil has been shown to be effective in cardioprotection from ischemic conditions but the underlying molecular mechanism to cope with doxorubicin-induced ROS is unclear. Our in vitro study using the HL-1 cardiomyocyte cell line derived from mouse atria reveals that the endogenous nitric oxide (NO) production was stimulated by nicorandil and arrested by NO synthase inhibition. Moreover, while the NO synthase activity was inhibited by doxorubicin-induced ROS, the NO synthase inhibition did not affect doxorubicin-induced ROS. The inhibition of NO synthase activity by doxorubicin was totally prevented by preincubation with nicorandil. Nicorandil also concentration-dependently (10 to 100 {$\mu$}M) decreased doxorubicin-induced ROS and the effect was antagonized by 5-hydroxydecanoate. The inhibition profile of doxorubicin-induced ROS by nicorandil was unaltered when an L-arginine derivative or a protein kinase G inhibitor was present. Preincubation with pinacidil mimicked the effect of nicorandil and the protection was eliminated by glibenclamide. Quantitative colocalization of fluorescence indicated that the mitochondrion was the target organelle of nicorandil and the observed response was a decrease in the mitochondrial inner membrane potential. Interference with H+ movement across the mitochondrial inner membrane, leading to depolarization, also protected from doxorubicin-induced ROS. The data indicate that activation of the mitochondrial ATP-sensitive K+ channel by nicorandil causing mitochondrial depolarization, without participation of the NO donor activity, was responsible for inhibition of the mitochondrial NADPH oxidase that is the main contributor to ROS production in cardiomyocytes. Impairment of the cytosolic Ca2+ signal induced by caffeine and the increase in lipid peroxidation, both of which are indicators of doxorubicin-induced oxidative stress, were also prevented by nicorandil.},

Differentially expressed genes can then be detected from variations in the counts of their cognate sequence tags. Here we present the first systematic study on the influence of random fluctuations and sampling size on the reliability of this kind of data. We establish a rigorous significance test and demonstrate its use on publicly available transcript profiles. The theory links the threshold of selection of putatively regulated genes (e.g., the number of pharmaceutical leads) to the fraction of false positive clones one is willing to risk. Our results delineate more precisely and extend the limits within which digital Northern data can be used.},

However, accurate modeling of DNA architecture at the intermediate scale of {$\sim$}50 kb-10 Mb is crucial for identifying functional interactions among regulatory elements and their target promoters. We describe a method, Fit-Hi-C, that assigns statistical confidence estimates to mid-range intra-chromosomal contacts by jointly modeling the random polymer looping effect and previously observed technical biases in Hi-C data sets. We demonstrate that our proposed approach computes accurate empirical null models of contact probability without any distribution assumption, corrects for binning artifacts, and provides improved statistical power relative to a previously described method. High-confidence contacts identified by Fit-Hi-C preferentially link expressed gene promoters to active enhancers identified by chromatin signatures in human embryonic stem cells (ESCs), capture 77\% of RNA polymerase II-mediated enhancer-promoter interactions identified using ChIA-PET in mouse ESCs, and confirm previously validated, cell line-specific interactions in mouse cortex cells. We observe that insulators and heterochromatin regions are hubs for high-confidence contacts, while promoters and strong enhancers are involved in fewer contacts. We also observe that binding peaks of master pluripotency factors such as NANOG and POU5F1 are highly enriched in high-confidence contacts for human ESCs. Furthermore, we show that pairs of loci linked by high-confidence contacts exhibit similar replication timing in human and mouse ESCs and preferentially lie within the boundaries of topological domains for human and mouse cell lines.},

  abstract = {Polygenic risk scores (PRS) estimate the genetic risk of an individual for a complex disease based on many genetic variants across the whole genome. In this study, we compared a series of computational models for estimation of breast cancer PRS. A deep neural network (DNN) was found to outperform alternative machine learning techniques and established statistical algorithms, including BLUP, BayesA, and LDpred. In the test cohort with 50\% prevalence, the Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve (AUC) were 67.4\% for DNN, 64.2\% for BLUP, 64.5\% for BayesA, and 62.4\% for LDpred. BLUP, BayesA, and LPpred all generated PRS that followed a normal distribution in the case population. However, the PRS generated by DNN in the case population followed a bimodal distribution composed of two normal distributions with distinctly different means. This suggests that DNN was able to separate the case population into a high-genetic-risk case subpopulation with an average PRS significantly higher than the control population and a normal-genetic-risk case subpopulation with an average PRS similar to the control population. This allowed DNN to achieve 18.8\% recall at 90\% precision in the test cohort with 50\% prevalence, which can be extrapolated to 65.4\% recall at 20\% precision in a general population with 12\% prevalence. Interpretation of the DNN model identified salient variants that were assigned insignificant p values by association studies, but were important for DNN prediction. These variants may be associated with the phenotype through nonlinear relationships.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The emergence of next-generation RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) provides tremendous opportunities for researchers to analyze alternative splicing on a genome-wide scale. However, accurate detection of intron retention (IR) events from RNA-Seq data has remained an unresolved challenge in next-generation sequencing (NGS) studies. RESULTS: We propose two new methods: IRcall and IRclassifier to detect IR events from RNA-Seq data. Our methods combine together gene expression information, read coverage within an intron, and read counts (within introns, within flanking exons, supporting splice junctions, and overlapping with 5' splice site/ 3' splice site), employing ranking strategy and classifiers to detect IR events. We applied our approaches to one published RNA-Seq data on contrasting skip mutant and wild-type in Arabidopsis thaliana. Compared with three state-of-the-art methods, IRcall and IRclassifier could effectively filter out false positives, and predict more accurate IR events. AVAILABILITY: The data and codes of IRcall and IRclassifier are available at http://mlg.hit.edu.cn/ybai/IR/IRcallAndIRclass.html.},

  abstract = {Point process statistics provides valuable tools for many ecological studies, where `points' are commonly determined to represent the locations of plants or animals and `marks' are additional items such as species or size. In the statistical analysis of marked point patterns, various correlation functions are used such as the mark variogram or the mark correlation function. Often the interpretation of these functions is not easy and the non-spatial ecologist is in need of support. In order to make the analysis of spatial point patterns more accessible to ecologists, we introduced and tested a new graphical method, the mark-mark scatterplot. This plot visualises the marks of point pairs of inter-point distances r smaller than some small distance rmax. We tested the application of the mark-mark scatterplot by reconsidering three quite different tree patterns: a pattern of longleaf pine trees from the southern US which was strongly influenced by fires, a tropical tree pattern of the species Shorea congestiflora from Sri Lanka and a Scots pine pattern from Siberia (Russia). The new method yielded previously undetected cause-effect information on mark behaviour at short inter-point distances and thus improved the analysis with mark correlation functions as well as complemented the information they provided. We discovered important new correlations in clusters of trees at close proximity. The application of the mark-mark scatterplot will facilitate the interpretation of point process summary statistics and will make point process analysis more accessible to ecologists not specialized in point process statistics.},

  abstract = {Deep learning is transforming the ability of life scientists to extract information from images. While these techniques have superior accuracy in comparison to conventional approaches and enable previously impossible analyses, their unique hardware and software requirements have prevented widespread adoption by life scientists. To meet this need, we have developed DeepCell 2.0, an open source library for training and delivering deep learning models with cloud computing. This library enables users to configure and manage a cloud deployment of DeepCell 2.0 on all commonly used operating systems. Using single-cell segmentation as a use case, we show that users with suitable training data can train models and analyze data with those models through a web interface. We demonstrate that by matching analysis tasks with their hardware requirements, we can efficiently use computational resources in the cloud and scale those resources to meet demand, significantly reducing the time necessary for large-scale image analysis. By reducing the barriers to entry, this work will empower life scientists to apply deep learning methods to their data. A persistent deployment is available at http://www.deepcell.org.}

  abstract = {The proto-oncogene KRAS is mutated in a wide array of human cancers, most of which are aggressive and respond poorly to standard therapies. Although the identification of specific oncogenes has led to the development of clinically effective, molecularly targeted therapies in some cases, KRAS has remained refractory to this approach. A complementary strategy for targeting KRAS is to identify gene products that, when inhibited, result in cell death only in the presence of an oncogenic allele. Here we have used systematic RNA interference to detect synthetic lethal partners of oncogenic KRAS and found that the non-canonical IkappaB kinase TBK1 was selectively essential in cells that contain mutant KRAS. Suppression of TBK1 induced apoptosis specifically in human cancer cell lines that depend on oncogenic KRAS expression. In these cells, TBK1 activated NF-kappaB anti-apoptotic signals involving c-Rel and BCL-XL (also known as BCL2L1) that were essential for survival, providing mechanistic insights into this synthetic lethal interaction. These observations indicate that TBK1 and NF-kappaB signalling are essential in KRAS mutant tumours, and establish a general approach for the rational identification of co-dependent pathways in cancer.},

Most methods for determining CNV rely on admixtures of cells in which information regarding genetic heterogeneity is lost.

Single-nucleus sequencing (SNS), combines flow sorting of single nuclei on the basis of DNA content and whole-genome amplification (WGA); this is followed by next-generation sequencing to quantize genomic intervals in a genome-wide manner. Multiplexing of single cells is discussed. In addition, we outline informatic approaches that correct for biases inherent in the WGA procedure and allow for accurate determination of copy number profiles. All together, the protocol takes {$\sim$}3 d from flow cytometry to sequence-ready DNA libraries.},

We present an overview of these approaches in fixed and live cells and their input in understanding the key steps of mRNA journey: transport across the nucleoplasm, export through the nuclear pores and delivery to its final cytoplasmic location. This review puts a particular emphasis on the coupling of mRNA transport with translation, such as localization-dependent translational regulation and translation-dependent mRNA localization. We also highlight the recently discovered translation factories, and how cellular and viral RNAs can hijack membrane transport systems to travel in the cytoplasm.},

In addition, it allows extraction of a multivariate feature set quantifying subcellular patterning and spatial properties of transcripts and their cell-to-cell variability. This has multiple implications for the functional interpretation of cell-to-cell variability in gene expression and enables the unbiased identification of functionally relevant in situ signatures of the transcriptome without the need for perturbations.

The general idea is to introduce an entropic regularization of the initial linear program. This regularized problem corresponds to a Kullback\textendash Leibler Bregman divergence projection of a vector (representing some initial joint distribution) on the polytope of constraints. We show that for many problems related to optimal transport, the set of linear constraints can be split in an intersection of a few simple constraints, for which the projections can be computed in closed form. This allows us to make use of iterative Bregman projections (when there are only equality constraints) or, more generally, Bregman\textendash Dykstra iterations (when inequality constraints are involved). We illustrate the usefulness of this approach for several variational problems related to optimal transport: barycenters for the optimal transport metric, tomographic reconstruction, multimarginal optimal transport, and in particular its application to Brenier's relaxed solutions of incompressible Euler equations, partial unbalanced optimal transport, and optimal transport with capacity constraints.},

  abstract = {Messenger RNA (mRNA) is a fundamental intermediate in the expression of proteins. As an integral part of this important process, protein production can be localized by the targeting of mRNA to a specific subcellular compartment. The subcellular destination of mRNA is suggested to be governed by a region of its primary sequence or secondary structure, which consequently dictates the recruitment of trans-acting factors, such as RNA-binding proteins or regulatory RNAs, to form a messenger ribonucleoprotein particle. This molecular ensemble is requisite for precise and spatiotemporal control of gene expression. In the context of RNA localization, the description of the binding preferences of an RNA-binding protein defines a motif, and one, or more, instance of a given motif is defined as a localization element (zip code). In this chapter, we first discuss the cis-regulatory motifs previously identified as mRNA localization elements. We then describe motif representation in terms of entropy and information content and offer an overview of motif databases and search algorithms. Finally, we provide an outline of the motif topology of asymmetrically localized mRNA molecules.}

In vitro selection methods, such as RNAcompete and RNA Bind-n-Seq, have defined the consensus target motifs of hundreds of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). However, readily available information about the distribution features of these motifs across full transcriptomes was hitherto lacking. Here, we introduce oRNAment (o RNA motifs enrichment in transcriptomes), a database that catalogues the putative motif instances of 223 RBPs, encompassing 453 motifs, in a transcriptome-wide fashion. The database covers 525 718 complete coding and non-coding RNA species across the transcriptomes of human and four prominent model organisms: Caenorhabditis elegans, Danio rerio, Drosophila melanogaster and Mus musculus. The unique features of oRNAment include: (i) hosting of the most comprehensive mapping of RBP motif instances to date, with 421 133 612 putative binding sites described across five species; (ii) options for the user to filter the data according to a specific threshold; (iii) a user-friendly interface and efficient back-end allowing the rapid querying of the data through multiple angles (i.e. transcript, RBP, or sequence attributes) and (iv) generation of several interactive data visualization charts describing the results of user queries. oRNAment is freely available at http://rnabiology.ircm.qc.ca/oRNAment/.},

Here we present a polymer-physics-based approach (PRISMR) to model 3D chromatin folding and to predict enhancer\textendash promoter contacts. PRISMR predicts higher-order chromatin structure from genome-wide chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) data. Using the EPHA4 locus as a model, the effects of pathogenic SVs are predicted in silico and compared to Hi-C data generated from mouse limb buds and patient-derived fibroblasts. PRISMR deconvolves the folding complexity of the EPHA4 locus and identifies SV-induced ectopic contacts and alterations of 3D genome organization in homozygous or heterozygous states. We show that SVs can reconfigure topologically associating domains, thereby producing extensive rewiring of regulatory interactions and causing disease by gene misexpression. PRISMR can be used to predict interactions in silico, thereby providing a tool for analyzing the disease-causing potential of SVs.},

Here, we explore non-coding functions for mRNAs associated with focal adhesions (FAs), cellular structures responsible for mediating cell adhesion and response to changes in the extracellular matrix (ECM). Using high-throughput single molecule imaging and genomic profiling approaches, we find that mRNAs with distinct sequence characteristics localize to FAs in different human cell types. Notably, {$\sim$}85\% of FA-mRNAs are not translationally active at steady state or under conditions of FA dissolution or activation. Untranslated mRNA sequences are anchored to FA based on their functional states by the RNA binding protein, G3BP1, forming biomolecular granules. Removing RNA or G3BP1, but not blocking new polypeptide synthesis, dramatically changes FA protein composition and organization, resulting in loss of cell contractility and cellular ability to adapt to changing ECM. We have therefor uncovered a novel, non-coding role for mRNAs as scaffolds to maintain FA structure and function, broadening our understating of noncanonical mRNA functions.},

Alternative splice site selection is inherently competitive and the probability of a given splice site to be used also depends on the strength of neighboring sites. Here, we present a new model named the competitive splice site model (COSSMO), which explicitly accounts for these competitive effects and predicts the percent selected index (PSI) distribution over any number of putative splice sites. We model an alternative splicing event as the choice of a 3{${'}$} acceptor site conditional on a fixed upstream 5{${'}$} donor site or the choice of a 5{${'}$} donor site conditional on a fixed 3{${'}$} acceptor site. We build four different architectures that use convolutional layers, communication layers, long short-term memory and residual networks, respectively, to learn relevant motifs from sequence alone. We also construct a new dataset from genome annotations and RNA-Seq read data that we use to train our model. Results COSSMO is able to predict the most frequently used splice site with an accuracy of 70\% on unseen test data, and achieve an R2 of 0.6 in modeling the PSI distribution. We visualize the motifs that COSSMO learns from sequence and show that COSSMO recognizes the consensus splice site sequences and many known splicing factors with high specificity.},

PARAFAC is a generalization of PCA to higher order arrays, but some of the characteristics of the method are quite different from the ordinary two-way case. There is no rotation problem in PARAFAC, and e.g., pure spectra can be recovered from multi-way spectral data. One cannot as in PCA estimate components successively as this will give a model with poorer fit, than if the simultaneous solution is estimated. Finally scaling and centering is not as straightforward in the multi-way case as in the two-way case. An important advantage of using multi-way methods instead of unfolding methods is that the estimated models are very simple in a mathematical sense, and therefore more robust and easier to interpret. All these aspects plus more are explained in this tutorial and an implementation in Matlab code is available, that contains most of the features explained in the text. Three examples show how PARAFAC can be used for specific problems. The applications include subjects as: Analysis of variance by PARAFAC, a five-way application of PARAFAC, PARAFAC with half the elements missing, PARAFAC constrained to positive solutions and PARAFAC for regression as in principal component regression.}

Local actin remodeling underlies some forms of plasticity and may be facilitated by local {$\beta$}-actin synthesis, but dynamic information is lacking. In this work, we use single-molecule in situ hybridization to demonstrate that dendritic {$\beta$}-actin messenger RNA (mRNA) and ribosomes are in a masked, neuron-specific form. Chemically induced long-term potentiation prompts transient mRNA unmasking, which depends on factors active during synaptic activity. Ribosomes and single {$\beta$}-actin mRNA motility increase after stimulation, indicative of release from complexes. Hence, the single-molecule assays we developed allow for the quantification of activity-induced unmasking and availability for active translation. Further, our work demonstrates that {$\beta$}-actin mRNA and ribosomes are in a masked state that is alleviated by stimulation.},

Classified as a primitive neural ectoderm tumor; it is thought to arise from granule cell precursors in the cerebellum. The standard of care consists of surgery, chemotherapy and age-dependent radiation therapy. Despite aggressive multimodality therapy; approximately 30\% of MB patients remain incurable. Moreover, for long-term survivors, the treatment related sequelae are often debilitating. Side effects include cerebellar mutism, sterility, neurocognitive deficits, and a substantial risk of developing secondary cancers. In a quest for more effective and targeted therapies, scientists have begun to investigate the biological events that not only initiate but also sustain the malignant phenotype in MB. Of particular interest is, the role of the tumor microenvironment in tumor pathogenesis. This review seeks to highlight several key processes observed in cancer biology, particularly the involvement of the tumor microenvironment, with relevant examples from MB.},

The crosstalk between fibroblasts and immune cells is an important axis in this process, but our understanding has been challenged by incomplete cell-type definition and biogeography. To address this challenge, we used MERFISH to profile the expression of 940 genes in 1.35 million cells imaged across the onset and recovery from a mouse colitis model. We identified diverse cell populations; charted their spatial organization; and revealed their polarization or recruitment in inflammation. We found a staged progression of inflammation-associated tissue neighborhoods defined, in part, by multiple inflammation-associated fibroblasts, with unique expression profiles, spatial localization, cell-cell interactions, and healthy fibroblast origins. Similar signatures in ulcerative colitis suggest conserved human processes. Broadly, we provide a framework for understanding inflammation-induced remodeling in the gut and other tissues.},

Analysis of a neuropil data set yielded a list of 8,379 transcripts of which 2,550 are localized in dendrites and/or axons. Using a fluorescent barcode strategy to label individual mRNAs, we show that their relative abundance in the neuropil varies over 3 orders of magnitude. High-resolution in situ hybridization validated the presence of mRNAs in both cultured neurons and hippocampal slices. Among the many mRNAs identified, we observed a large fraction of known synaptic proteins including signaling molecules, scaffolds and receptors. These results reveal a previously unappreciated enormous potential for the local protein synthesis machinery to supply, maintain and modify the dendritic and synaptic proteome.},

Multimodal techniques like Patch-seq enable simultaneously profiling the morphological, transcriptomic, and physiological characteristics of individual cells.

CAJAL uses concepts from metric geometry to accurately build, visualize, and integrate cell morphology summary spaces and establish associations with molecular and physiological data of individual cells. We demonstrate the utility of CAJAL by applying it to published Patchseq, patch-clamp, serial electron, and two-photon microscopy data, and show that it represents a substantial improvement in functionality, scope, and accuracy with respect to current methods for cell morphometry.},

Many labeling strategies have been developed for this purpose, ranging from the use of fluorescent markers to label-free approaches. However, differences in the channels available to each respective training dataset make it difficult to directly compare the effectiveness of these strategies across studies. Here we explore training models using subimage stacks composed of channels sampled from larger, `hyper-labeled', image stacks. This allows us to directly compare a variety of labeling strategies and training approaches on identical cells. This approach revealed that fluorescence-based strategies generally provide higher segmentation accuracies but were less accurate than label-free models when labeling was inconsistent. The relative strengths of label and label-free techniques could be combined through the use of merging fluorescence channels and out-of-focus brightfield images. Beyond comparing labeling strategies, using subimage stacks for training was also found to provide a method of simulating a wide range of labeling conditions, increasing the ability of the final model to accommodate a greater range of experimental setups.},

We present SpaOTsc, a method relying on structured optimal transport to recover spatial properties of scRNA-seq data by utilizing spatial measurements of a relatively small number of genes. A spatial metric for individual cells in scRNA-seq data is first established based on a map connecting it with the spatial measurements. The cell\textendash cell communications are then obtained by ``optimally transporting'' signal senders to target signal receivers in space. Using partial information decomposition, we next compute the intercellular gene\textendash gene information flow to estimate the spatial regulations between genes across cells. Four datasets are employed for cross-validation of spatial gene expression prediction and comparison to known cell\textendash cell communications. SpaOTsc has broader applications, both in integrating non-spatial single-cell measurements with spatial data, and directly in spatial single-cell transcriptomics data to reconstruct spatial cellular dynamics in tissues.},

  abstract = {Motivation: The long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) studies have been hot topics in the field of RNA biology. Recent studies have shown that their subcellular localizations carry important information for understanding their complex biological functions. Considering the costly and time-consuming experiments for identifying subcellular localization of lncRNAs, computational methods are urgently desired. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no computational tools for predicting the lncRNA subcellular locations to date. Results: In this study, we report an ensemble classifier-based predictor, lncLocator, for predicting the lncRNA subcellular localizations. To fully exploit lncRNA sequence information, we adopt both k-mer features and high-level abstraction features generated by unsupervised deep models, and construct four classifiers by feeding these two types of features to support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF), respectively. Then we use a stacked ensemble strategy to combine the four classifiers and get the final prediction results. The current lncLocator can predict five subcellular localizations of lncRNAs, including cytoplasm, nucleus, cytosol, ribosome and exosome, and yield an overall accuracy of 0.59 on the constructed benchmark dataset. Availability and implementation: The lncLocator is available at www.csbio.sjtu.edu.cn/bioinf/lncLocator. Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract = {CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Huntington disease (HD) is a progressive disorder of motor, cognitive, and psychiatric disturbances. The mean age of onset is 35 to 44 years, and the median survival time is 15 to 18 years after onset. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of HD rests on positive family history, characteristic clinical findings, and the detection of an expansion of 36 or more CAG trinucleotide repeats in HTT. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Pharmacologic therapy including typical neuroleptics (haloperidol), atypical neuroleptics (olanzapine), benzodiazepines, or the monoamine-depleting agent tetrabenazine for choreic movements; anti-parkinsonian agents for hypokinesia and rigidity; psychotropic drugs or some types of antiepileptic drugs for psychiatric disturbances (depression, psychotic symptoms, outbursts of aggression); valproic acid for myoclonic hyperkinesia. Supportive care with attention to nursing needs, dietary intake, special equipment, and eligibility for state and federal benefits. Prevention of secondary complications: Attention to the usual potential complications in persons requiring long-term supportive care and to side effects associated with pharmacologic treatments. Surveillance: Regular evaluations of the appearance and severity of chorea, rigidity, gait problems, depression, behavioral changes, and cognitive decline; routine assessment of functional abilities using the Behavior Observation Scale Huntington (BOSH) and the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS). Agents/circumstances to avoid: L-dopa-containing compounds (may increase chorea), alcohol consumption, smoking. Other: Children and adolescents with a parent with HD may benefit from referral to a local HD support group for educational materials and psychological support. GENETIC COUNSELING: HD is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Offspring of an individual with a pathogenic variant have a 50\% chance of inheriting the disease-causing allele. Predictive testing in asymptomatic adults at risk is available but requires careful thought (including pre- and post-test genetic counseling) as there is currently no cure for the disorder. However, asymptomatic individuals at risk may be eligible to participate in clinical trials. Predictive testing is not considered appropriate for asymptomatic at-risk individuals younger than age 18 years. Prenatal testing by molecular genetic testing is possible.}

  abstract = {Abstract                            Intracellular RNA localization is a widespread and dynamic phenomenon that compartmentalizes gene expression and contributes to the functional polarization of cells. Thus far, mechanisms of RNA localization identified in               Drosophila               have been based on a few RNAs in different tissues, and a comprehensive mechanistic analysis of RNA localization in a single tissue is lacking. Here, by subcellular spatial transcriptomics we identify RNAs localized in the apical and basal domains of the columnar follicular epithelium (FE) and we analyze the mechanisms mediating their localization. Whereas the dynein/BicD/Egl machinery controls apical RNA localization, basally-targeted RNAs require kinesin-1 to overcome a default dynein-mediated transport. Moreover, a non-canonical, translation- and dynein-dependent mechanism mediates apical localization of a subgroup of dynein-activating adaptor-encoding RNAs (               BicD               ,               Bsg25D               ,               hook               ). Altogether, our study identifies at least three mechanisms underlying RNA localization in the FE, and suggests a possible link between RNA localization and dynein/dynactin/adaptor complex formation in vivo.},

However, the implications of somatic HLA and B2M mutations have not been fully explored in the context of antigen presentation via the MHC-I molecule during tumor development.

RESULTS: Somatic B2M and HLA mutations in microsatellite stable tumors were associated with higher overall mutation burden and a larger fraction of HLA-binding neoantigens when compared to B2M and HLA wild type tumors. B2M and HLA mutations were highly enriched in patients with microsatellite instability. B2M mutations tended to occur relatively early during patients' respective tumor development, whereas HLA mutations were either early or late events. In addition, B2M and HLA mutated patients had higher levels of immune infiltration by natural killer and CD8+ T cells and higher levels of cytotoxicity.

  abstract = {Motivation: Eukaryotic chromosomes adapt a complex and highly dynamic three-dimensional (3D) structure, which profoundly affects different cellular functions and outcomes including changes in epigenetic landscape and in gene expression. Making the scenario even more complex, cancer cells harbor chromosomal abnormalities [e.g. copy number variations (CNVs) and translocations] altering their genomes both at the sequence level and at the level of 3D organization. High-throughput chromo-some conformation capture techniques (e.g. Hi-C), which are originally developed for decoding the 3D structure of the chromatin, provide a great opportunity to simultaneously identify the locations of genomic rearrangements and to investigate the 3D genome organization in cancer cells. Even though Hi-C data has been used for validating known rearrangements, computational methods that can distin-guish rearrangement signals from the inherent biases of Hi-C data and from the actual 3D conforma-tion of chromatin, and can precisely detect rearrangement locations de novo have been missing. Results: In this work, we characterize how intra and inter-chromosomal Hi-C contacts are distrib-uted for normal and rearranged chromosomes to devise a new set of algorithms (i) to identify genomic segments that correspond to CNV regions such as amplifications and deletions (HiCnv), (ii) to call inter-chromosomal translocations and their boundaries (HiCtrans) from Hi-C experiments and (iii) to simulate Hi-C data from genomes with desired rearrangements and abnormalities (AveSim) in order to select optimal parameters for and to benchmark the accuracy of our methods. Our results on 10 different cancer cell lines with Hi-C data show that we identify a total number of 105 amplifications and 45 deletions together with 90 translocations, whereas we identify virtually no such events for two karyotypically normal cell lines. Our CNV predictions correlate very well with whole genome sequencing data among chromosomes with CNV events for a breast cancer cell line (r {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.89) and capture most of the CNVs we simulate using Avesim. For HiCtrans predic-tions, we report evidence from the literature for 30 out of 90 translocations for eight of our cancer cell lines. Furthermore, we show that our tools identify and correctly classify relatively under-studied rearrangements such as double minutes and homogeneously staining regions. Considering the inherent limitations of existing techniques for karyotyping (i.e. missing balanced rearrangements and those near repetitive regions), the accurate identification of CNVs and translo-cations in a cost-effective and high-throughput setting is still a challenge. Our results show that the set of tools we develop effectively utilize moderately sequenced Hi-C libraries (100\textendash 300 million reads) to identify known and de novo chromosomal rearrangements/abnormalities in well-established cancer cell lines. With the decrease in required number of cells and the increase in attainable resolution, we believe that our framework will pave the way towards comprehensive mapping of genomic rearrangements in primary cells from cancer patients using Hi-C.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT) in which the marginal conditions are relaxed (using weighted penalties in lieu of equality) and no additional regularization is enforced on the OT plan. In this context, we show that the corresponding optimization problem can be reformulated as a non-negative penalized linear regression problem. This reformulation allows us to propose novel algorithms inspired from inverse problems and nonnegative matrix factorization. In particular, we consider majorization-minimization which leads in our setting to efficient multiplicative updates for a variety of penalties. Furthermore, we derive for the first time an efficient algorithm to compute the regularization path of UOT with quadratic penalties. The proposed algorithm provides a continuity of piece-wise linear OT plans converging to the solution of balanced OT (corresponding to infinite penalty weights). We perform several numerical experiments on simulated and real data illustrating the new algorithms, and provide a detailed discussion about more sophisticated optimization tools that can further be used to solve OT problems thanks to our reformulation.},

  abstract = {A continuing challenge in quantitative cell biology is the accurate and robust 3D segmentation of structures of interest from fluorescence microscopy images in an automated, reproducible, and widely accessible manner for subsequent interpretable data analysis. We describe the Allen Cell and Structure Segmenter (Segmenter), a Python-based open source toolkit developed for 3D segmentation of cells and intracellular structures in fluorescence microscope images. This toolkit brings together classic image segmentation and iterative deep learning workflows first to generate initial high-quality 3D intracellular structure segmentations and then to easily curate these results to generate the ground truths for building robust and accurate deep learning models. The toolkit takes advantage of the high-replicate 3D live cell image data collected at the Allen Institute for Cell Science of over 30 endogenous fluorescently tagged human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) lines. Each cell line represents a different intracellular structure with one or more distinct localization patterns within undifferentiated hiPS cells and hiPSCderived cardiomyocytes. The Segmenter consists of two complementary elements, a classic image segmentation workflow with a restricted set of algorithms and parameters and an iterative deep learning segmentation workflow. We created a collection of 20 classic image segmentation workflows based on 20 distinct and representative intracellular structure localization patterns as a ``lookup table'' reference and starting point for users. The iterative deep learning workflow can take over when the classic segmentation workflow is insufficient. Two straightforward ``human-in-the-loop'' curation strategies convert a set of classic image segmentation workflow results into a set of 3D ground truth images for iterative model training without the need for manual painting in 3D. The deep learning model architectures used in this toolkit were designed and tested specifically for 3D fluorescence microscope images and implemented as readable scripts. The Segmenter thus leverages state of the art computer vision algorithms in an accessible way to facilitate their application by the experimental biology researcher.},

Mapping the projections to 11 areas of 3,579 neurons in mouse auditory cortex using BARseq confirmed the laminar organization of the three top classes (intratelencephalic [IT], pyramidal tract-like [PT-like], and corticothalamic [CT]) of projection neurons. In depth analysis uncovered a projection type restricted almost exclusively to transcriptionally defined subtypes of IT neurons. By bridging anatomical and transcriptomic approaches at cellular resolution with high throughput, BARseq can potentially uncover the organizing principles underlying the structure and formation of neural circuits.},

Because manually detecting and following large numbers of individual particles is not feasible, automated computational methods have been developed for these tasks by many groups. Aiming to perform an objective comparison of methods, we gathered the community and organized an open competition in which participating teams applied their own methods independently to a commonly defined data set including diverse scenarios. Performance was assessed using commonly defined measures. Although no single method performed best across all scenarios, the results revealed clear differences between the various approaches, leading to notable practical conclusions for users and developers.},

We address this challenge with Sei, a framework for integrating human genetics data with sequence information to discover the regulatory basis of traits and diseases. Sei learns a vocabulary of regulatory activities, called sequence classes, using a deep learning model that predicts 21,907 chromatin profiles across {$>$}1,300 cell lines and tissues. Sequence classes provide a global classification and quantification of sequence and variant effects based on diverse regulatory activities, such as cell type-specific enhancer functions. These predictions are supported by tissue-specific expression, expression quantitative trait loci and evolutionary constraint data. Furthermore, sequence classes enable characterization of the tissue-specific, regulatory architecture of complex traits and generate mechanistic hypotheses for individual regulatory pathogenic mutations. We provide Sei as a resource to elucidate the regulatory basis of human health and disease.},

Measurement of these properties at the transcriptome scale in single cells will give answers to many questions related to gene expression and regulation. Single-molecule RNA imaging approaches, such as single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH), are powerful tools for counting and mapping RNA; however, the number of RNA species that can be simultaneously imaged in individual cells has been limited. This makes it challenging to perform transcriptomic analysis of single cells in a spatially resolved manner. Here, we report multiplexed error-robust FISH (MERFISH), a single-molecule imaging method that allows thousands of RNA species to be imaged in single cells by using combinatorial FISH labeling with encoding schemes capable of detecting and/or correcting errors.                                         RATIONALE               We labeled each cellular RNA with a set of encoding probes, which contain targeting sequences that bind the RNA and readout sequences that bind fluorescently labeled readout probes. Each RNA species is encoded with a particular combination of readout sequences. We used successive rounds of hybridization and imaging, each with a different readout probe, to identify the readout sequences bound to each RNA and to decode the RNA. In principle, combinatorial labeling allows the number of detectable RNA species to grow exponentially with the number of imaging rounds, but the detection errors also increase exponentially. To combat such accumulating errors, we exploited error-robust encoding schemes used in digital electronics, such as the extended Hamming code, in the design of our encoding probes but modified these schemes in order to account for the error properties in FISH measurements. We assigned each RNA a binary word in our modified Hamming code and encoded the RNA with a combination of readout sequences according to this binary word.                                         RESULTS               We first imaged 140 RNA species in human fibroblast cells using MERFISH with 16 rounds of hybridization and a modified Hamming code capable of both error detection and correction. We obtained \textasciitilde 80\% detection efficiency and observed excellent correlation of RNA copy numbers determined with MERFISH with both bulk RNA sequencing data and conventional smFISH measurements of individual genes.               Next, we used an alternative MERFISH encoding scheme, which is capable of detecting but not correcting errors, to image 1001 RNA species in individual cells using only 14 rounds of hybridization. The observed RNA copy numbers again correlate well with bulk sequencing data. However, the detection efficiency is only one-third that of the error-correcting encoding scheme.                                We performed correlation analysis of the 10                 4                 to 10                 6                 pairs of measured genes and identified many covarying gene groups that share common regulatory elements. Such grouping allowed us to hypothesize potential functions of \textasciitilde 100 unannotated or partially annotated genes of unknown functions. We further analyzed correlations in the spatial distributions of different RNA species and identified groups of RNAs with different distribution patterns in the cell.                                                        DISCUSSION               This highly multiplexed imaging approach enables analyses based on the variation and correlation of copy numbers and spatial distributions of a large number of RNA species within single cells. Such analyses should facilitate the delineation of regulatory networks and in situ identification of cell types. We envision that this approach will allow spatially resolved transcriptomes to be determined for single cells.                        ,                             Knowledge of the expression profile and spatial landscape of the transcriptome in individual cells is essential for understanding the rich repertoire of cellular behaviors.

We performed correlation analysis of the 10                 4                 to 10                 6                 pairs of measured genes and identified many covarying gene groups that share common regulatory elements. Such grouping allowed us to hypothesize potential functions of \textasciitilde 100 unannotated or partially annotated genes of unknown functions. We further analyzed correlations in the spatial distributions of different RNA species and identified groups of RNAs with different distribution patterns in the cell.                                                        DISCUSSION               This highly multiplexed imaging approach enables analyses based on the variation and correlation of copy numbers and spatial distributions of a large number of RNA species within single cells. Such analyses should facilitate the delineation of regulatory networks and in situ identification of cell types. We envision that this approach will allow spatially resolved transcriptomes to be determined for single cells.                        ,                             Knowledge of the expression profile and spatial landscape of the transcriptome in individual cells is essential for understanding the rich repertoire of cellular behaviors. Here, we report multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH), a single-molecule imaging approach that allows the copy numbers and spatial localizations of thousands of RNA species to be determined in single cells. Using error-robust encoding schemes to combat single-molecule labeling and detection errors, we demonstrated the imaging of 100 to 1000 distinct RNA species in hundreds of individual cells. Correlation analysis of the \textasciitilde 10               4               to 10               6               pairs of genes allowed us to constrain gene regulatory networks, predict novel functions for many unannotated genes, and identify distinct spatial distribution patterns of RNAs that correlate with properties of the encoded proteins.},

  abstract = {The human genome contains more than 200,000 gene isoforms. However, different isoforms can be highly similar, and with an average length of 1.5kb remain difficult to study with short read sequencing. To systematically evaluate the ability to study the transcriptome at a resolution of individual isoforms we profiled 5 human cell lines with short read cDNA sequencing and Nanopore long read direct RNA, amplification-free direct cDNA, PCR-cDNA sequencing. The long read protocols showed a high level of consistency, with amplification-free RNA and cDNA sequencing being most similar. While short and long reads generated comparable gene expression estimates, they differed substantially for individual isoforms. We find that increased read length improves read-to-transcript assignment, identifies interactions between alternative promoters and splicing, enables the discovery of novel transcripts from repetitive regions, facilitates the quantification of full-length fusion isoforms and enables the simultaneous profiling of m6A RNA modifications when RNA is sequenced directly. Our study demonstrates the advantage of long read RNA sequencing and provides a comprehensive resource that will enable the development and benchmarking of computational methods for profiling complex transcriptional events at isoform-level resolution.},

In this paper, we describe a scalable endto-end tree boosting system called XGBoost, which is used widely by data scientists to achieve state-of-the-art results on many machine learning challenges. We propose a novel sparsity-aware algorithm for sparse data and weighted quantile sketch for approximate tree learning. More importantly, we provide insights on cache access patterns, data compression and sharding to build a scalable tree boosting system. By combining these insights, XGBoost scales beyond billions of examples using far fewer resources than existing systems.},

These processes are crucial for cells to maintain their proper organization and carry out specialized functions in the body, consequently genetic perturbations that clog up these addressing systems can contribute to disease aetiology. The trafficking of RNA molecules represents an important layer in the control of cellular organization, a process that is both highly prevalent and for which features of the regulatory machineries have been deeply conserved evolutionarily. RNA localization is commonly driven by trans-regulatory factors, including RNA binding proteins at the core, which recognize specific cis-acting zipcode elements within the RNA transcripts. Here, we first review the functions and biological benefits of intracellular RNA trafficking, from the perspective of both coding and non-coding RNAs. Next, we discuss the molecular mechanisms that modulate this localization, emphasizing the diverse features of the cis- and trans-regulators involved, while also highlighting emerging technologies and resources that will prove instrumental in deciphering RNA targeting pathways. We then discuss recent findings that reveal how co-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms operating in the nucleus can dictate the downstream cytoplasmic localization of RNAs.

To understand the molecular characteristics underlying their heterogeneity and to identify whether such characteristics represent risk factors for patients with this disease, we performed an integrated genomic analysis of a large series of primary tumors.

Non-negative matrix factorization-based clustering of mRNA expression data was used to identify molecular subgroups of medulloblastoma; DNA copy number, miRNA profiles, and clinical outcomes were analyzed for each. We additionally validated our findings in three previously published independent medulloblastoma data sets. RESULTS: Identified are six molecular subgroups of medulloblastoma, each with a unique combination of numerical and structural chromosomal aberrations that globally influence mRNA and miRNA expression. We reveal the relative contribution of each subgroup to clinical outcome as a whole and show that a previously unidentified molecular subgroup, characterized genetically by c-MYC copy number gains and transcriptionally by enrichment of photoreceptor pathways and increased miR-183 approximately 96 approximately 182 expression, is associated with significantly lower rates of event-free and overall survivals.

A total of 32 mRNAs displayed specific cytoplasmic localizations, and we observed local translation at unexpected locations, including cytoplasmic protrusions, cell edges, endosomes, Golgi, the nuclear envelope and centrosomes, the latter being cell-cycle dependent. Surprisingly, mRNA localization frequently required ongoing translation, indicating widespread co-translational targeting. Nevertheless, the kinesin KIF1C localized mRNAs to cytoplasmic protrusions in a translation-independent manner. Interestingly, while P-body accumulation was frequent (15 mRNAs), four mRNAs accumulated in foci that were distinct structures. These foci lacked the mature protein, but nascent polypeptide imaging showed that they were specialized translation factories. For {$\beta$}-catenin, foci formation was regulated by Wnt, relied on APCdependent polysome aggregation, and led to nascent protein degradation. Thus, translation factories uniquely regulate nascent protein metabolism and create a fine granular compartmentalization of translation.},

An unsolved problem in this context is how to systematically identify the genomic variables that are drivers of systematic variation captured by PCA.

RESULTS: We introduce a new approach called the jackstraw that allows one to accurately identify genomic variables that are statistically significantly associated with any subset or linear combination of principal components (PCs). The proposed method can greatly simplify complex significance testing problems encountered in genomics and can be utilized to identify the genomic variables significantly associated with latent variables. Using simulation, we demonstrate that our method attains accurate measures of statistical significance over a range of relevant scenarios. We consider yeast cell-cycle gene expression data, and show that the proposed method can be used to straightforwardly identify genes that are cell-cycle regulated with an accurate measure of statistical significance.

Using our method, we find a greater enrichment for inflammatory-related gene sets compared to the original analysis that utilizes a clinically defined, although likely imprecise, phenotype.

Here we unravel the core splice factor SF3A3 at the nexus of a translation-based program that rewires splicing during malignant transformation. Upon MYC hyperactivation, SF3A3 levels are modulated translationally through an RNA stem-loop in an eIF3D-dependent manner. This ensures accurate splicing of mRNAs enriched for mitochondrial regulators. Altered SF3A3 translation leads to metabolic reprogramming and stem-like properties that fuel MYC tumorigenic potential in vivo. Our analysis reveals that SF3A3 protein levels predict molecular and phenotypic features of aggressive human breast cancers. These findings unveil a post-transcriptional interplay between splicing and translation that governs critical facets of MYC-driven oncogenesis.},

There is a lack of standardized tools for analyzing spatial transcriptomics data, leading many groups to write their own in-house tools that are often poorly documented and not generalizable. To address this, we have expanded and improved the starfish library and used those tools to create PIPEFISH, a semi-automated and generalizable pipeline that performs transcript annotation for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)-based spatial transcriptomics. We used this pipeline to annotate transcript locations from three real datasets from three different common types of FISH image-based experiments, MERFISH, seqFISH, and targeted in situ sequencing (ISS), and verified that the results were high quality using the internal quality metrics of the pipeline and also a comparison with an orthogonal method of measuring RNA expression. PIPEFISH is a publicly available and open-source tool.},

In recent years, this area has been dominated by convolutional neural networks, which typically outperform previously-designed methods as a result of automated scanning for influential sequence motifs. However, those architectures do not allow for the efficient processing of the full genomic sequence. As an improvement, we introduce transformer architectures for whole genome sequence labeling tasks. We show that these architectures, recently introduced for natural language processing, are better suited for processing and annotating long DNA sequences. We apply existing networks and introduce an optimized method for the calculation of attention from input nucleotides. To demonstrate this, we evaluate our architecture on several sequence labeling tasks, and find it to achieve state-of-the-art performances when comparing it to specialized models for the annotation of transcription start sites, translation initiation sites and 4mC methylation in E. coli.},

  abstract = {Tissue and organ function rely on the organization of cells and molecules in specific spatial structures. In order to understand these structures and how they relate to tissue function in health and disease, we would ideally be able to rapidly profile gene expression over large tissue volumes. To this end, in recent years multiple molecular assays have been developed that can image from a dozen to \textasciitilde 100 individual proteins1\textendash 3 or RNAs4\textendash 10 in a sample at single-cell resolution, with barcodes to allow multiplexing across genes. These approaches have serious limitations with respect to (i) the number of genes that can be studied; and (ii) imaging time, due to the need for high-resolution to resolve individual signals. Here, we show that both challenges can be overcome by introducing an approach that leverages the biological fact that gene expression is often structured across both cells and tissue organization. We develop Composite In Situ Imaging (CISI), that combines this biological insight with algorithmic advances in compressed sensing to achieve greater efficiency. We demonstrate that CISI accurately recovers the spatial abundance of each of 37 individual genes from 11 composite measurements in 12 bisected mouse brain coronal sections covering 180mm2 and 476,276 cells without the need for spot-level resolution. CISI achieves the current scale of multiplexing with two orders of magnitude greater efficiency, and can be leveraged in combination with existing methods to multiplex far beyond current scales.},

Geographically weighted colocation measures for categorical data are further developed in this article by generalizing Leslie and Kronenfeld's global measure as well as specifying a local counterpart for each global statistic using two different types of spatial filters: fixed and adaptive.

Early analyses of differential expression have aimed at identifying differences between subpopulations to identify subpopulation markers. More generally, such methods compare expression levels across sets of cells, thus leading to cross-condition analyses. Given the emergence of replicated multi-condition scRNA-seq datasets, an area of increasing focus is making sample-level inferences, termed here as differential state analysis; however, it is not clear which statistical framework best handles this situation. Here, we surveyed methods to perform cross-condition differential state analyses, including cell-level mixed models and methods based on aggregated pseudobulk data. To evaluate method performance, we developed a flexible simulation that mimics multi-sample scRNA-seq data. We analyzed scRNA-seq data from mouse cortex cells to uncover subpopulation-specific responses to lipopolysaccharide treatment, and provide robust tools for multi-condition analysis within the               muscat               R package.},

Deregulation of one or more of these pathways by the mutant Htt protein has been suggested to contribute to the disease pathogenesis. Our recent discovery-based proteomics studies have uncovered RNA binding proteins and translation factors associated with the endogenous Htt protein purified from mouse brains, suggesting a potential new role for Htt in RNA transport and translation. OBJECTIVE: To investigate how Htt might affect RNA metabolism we set out to purify and analyze RNA associated with Htt. METHODS: RNA was extracted from immunopurified Htt-containing protein complexes and analyzed by microarrays and RNA-Seq. RESULTS: Surprisingly, the most enriched mRNA that co-purified with Htt was Htt mRNA itself. The association of Htt protein and Htt mRNA was detected independent of intact ribosomes suggesting that it is not an RNA undergoing translation. Furthermore, we identified the recently reported mis-spliced Htt mRNA encoding a truncated protein comprised of exon 1 and a portion of the downstream intron in the immunoprecipitates containing mutant Htt protein. We show that Htt protein co-localizes with Htt mRNA and that wild-type Htt reduces expression of a reporter construct harboring the Htt 3' UTR. CONCLUSIONS: HD protein is found in a complex with its own mRNA and RNA binding proteins and translation factors. Htt may be involved in modulating its expression through post-transcriptional pathways. It is possible that Htt shares mechanistic properties similar to RNA binding proteins such as TDP-43 and FUS implicated in other neurodegenerative diseases.},

  abstract = {Closing the gap between measurable genetic information and observable traits is a longstanding challenge in genomics. Yet, the prediction of molecular phenotypes from DNA sequences alone remains limited and inaccurate, often driven by the scarcity of annotated data and the inability to transfer learnings between prediction tasks. Here, we present an extensive study of foundation models pre-trained on DNA sequences, named the Nucleotide Transformer, integrating information from 3,202 diverse human genomes, as well as 850 genomes from a wide range of species, including model and non-model organisms. These transformer models yield transferable, context-specific representations of nucleotide sequences, which allow for accurate molecular phenotype prediction even in low-data settings. We show that the sequence representations alone match or outperform specialized methods on 12 of 18 prediction tasks, and up to 15 after fine-tuning. Despite no supervision, the transformer models learned to focus attention on key genomic elements, including those that regulate gene expression, such as enhancers. Lastly, we demonstrate that utilizing model representations can improve the prioritization of functional genetic variants. The training and application of foundational models in genomics explored in this study provide a widely applicable stepping stone to bridge the gap of accurate molecular phenotype prediction from DNA sequence.

High-resolution imaging technologies to detect mRNAs and their translation state have revealed that all living organisms localize mRNAs in subcellular compartments and create translation hotspots, enabling cells to tune gene expression locally. Therefore, mRNA localization is a conserved and integral part of gene expression regulation from prokaryotic to eukaryotic cells. In this Review, we discuss the mechanisms of mRNA transport and local mRNA translation across the kingdoms of life and at organellar, subcellular and multicellular resolution. We also discuss the properties of messenger ribonucleoprotein and higher order RNA granules and how they may influence mRNA transport and local protein synthesis. Finally, we summarize the technological developments that allow us to study mRNA localization and local translation through the simultaneous detection of mRNAs and proteins in single cells, mRNA and nascent protein single-molecule imaging, and bulk RNA and protein detection methods.},

Current methods for cell segmentation in such studies rely on known membrane or cell boundary markers. However, for many tissues, an optimal set of markers is not known, and even within a tissue, different cell types may express different markers. Here we present RAMCES, a method that uses a convolutional neural network to learn the optimal markers for a new sample and outputs a weighted combination of the selected markers for segmentation. Testing RAMCES on several existing datasets indicates that it correctly identifies cell boundary markers, improving on methods that rely on a single marker or those that extend nuclei segmentations. Application to new spatial proteomics data demonstrates its usefulness for accurately assigning cell types based on the proteins expressed in segmented cells.},

In brain MRI analysis, image segmentation is commonly used for measuring and visualizing the brain's anatomical structures, for analyzing brain changes, for delineating pathological regions, and for surgical planning and image-guided interventions. In the last few decades, various segmentation techniques of different accuracy and degree of complexity have been developed and reported in the literature. In this paper we review the most popular methods commonly used for brain MRI segmentation. We highlight differences between them and discuss their capabilities, advantages, and limitations. To address the complexity and challenges of the brain MRI segmentation problem, we first introduce the basic concepts of image segmentation. Then, we explain different MRI preprocessing steps including image registration, bias field correction, and removal of nonbrain tissue. Finally, after reviewing different brain MRI segmentation methods, we discuss the validation problem in brain MRI segmentation.},

  abstract = {The Radial Coordinate Visualization (Radviz) technique has been widely used to effectively evaluate the existence of patterns in highly dimensional data sets. A crucial aspect of this technique lies in the arrangement of the dimensions, which determines the quality of the posterior visualization. Dimension arrangement (DA) has been shown to be an NP-problem and different heuristics have been proposed to solve it using optimization techniques. However, very little work has focused on understanding the relation between the arrangement of the dimensions and the quality of the visualization. In this paper we first present two variations of the DA problem: (1) a Radviz independent approach and (2) a Radviz dependent approach. We then describe the use of the Davies-Bouldin index to automatically evaluate the quality of a visualization i.e., its visual usefulness. Our empirical evaluation is extensive and uses both real and synthetic data sets in order to evaluate our proposed methods and to fully understand the impact that parameters such as number of samples, dimensions, or cluster separability have in the relation between the optimization algorithm and the visualization tool.}

However, expression profiles, especially when collected in large numbers, inherently contain variations introduced by technical artifacts (e.g. batch effects) and uninteresting biological variables (e.g. age) in addition to the true signals of interest. These sources of variations, called confounders, produce embeddings that fail to transfer to different domains, i.e. an embedding learned from one dataset with a specific confounder distribution does not generalize to different distributions. To remedy this problem, we attempt to disentangle confounders from true signals to generate biologically informative embeddings.},

  abstract = {Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) is a conserved self-tumor antigen which is overexpressed in most tumors and plays a critical role in tumor formation and progression. As such, TERT is an antigen of great relevance to develop widely applicable immunotherapies. CD4 T cells play a major role in the anti-cancer response alone or with other effector cells such as CD8 T cells and NK cells. To date, efforts have been made to identify TERT peptides capable of stimulating CD4 T cells that are also able to bind diverse MHC-II alleles to ease immune status monitoring and immunotherapies. Here, we review the current status of TERT biology, TERT/MHC-II immunobiology, and past and current vaccine clinical trials. We propose that monitoring CD4 T cell immunity against TERT is a simple and direct way to assess immune surveillance in cancer patients and a new way to predict the response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICPi). Finally, we present the initial results of a systematic discovery of TERT peptides able to bind the most common HLA Class II alleles worldwide and show that the repertoire of MHC-II TERT peptides is wider than currently appreciated.},

  abstract = {Understanding how splicing events are coordinated across numerous introns in metazoan RNA transcripts requires quantitative analyses of transient RNA processing events in living cells. We developed nanopore analysis of co-transcriptional processing (nano-COP), in which nascent RNAs are directly sequenced through nanopores, exposing the dynamics and patterns of RNA splicing without biases introduced by amplification. Long nano-COP reads reveal that, in human and Drosophila cells, splicing occurs after RNA polymerase II transcribes several kilobases of pre-mRNA, suggesting that metazoan splicing transpires distally from the transcription machinery. Inhibition of the branch-site recognition complex SF3B rapidly diminished global co-transcriptional splicing. We found that splicing order does not strictly follow the order of transcription and is associated with cis-acting elements, alternative splicing, and RNA-binding factors. Further, neighboring introns in human cells tend to be spliced concurrently, implying that splicing of these introns occurs cooperatively. Thus, nano-COP unveils the organizational complexity of RNA processing.},

Such information provides a solid foundation for mechanistic understanding of many biological processes in both health and disease that cannot be obtained by using traditional technologies. The development of computational methods plays important roles in extracting biological signals from raw data. Various approaches have been developed to overcome technology-specific limitations such as spatial resolution, gene coverage, sensitivity, and technical biases. Downstream analysis tools formulate spatial organization and cell\textendash cell communications as quantifiable properties, and provide algorithms to derive such properties. Integrative pipelines further assemble multiple tools in one package, allowing biologists to conveniently analyze data from beginning to end. In this review, we summarize the state of the art of spatial transcriptomic data analysis methods and pipelines, and discuss how they operate on different technological platforms.},

As a concrete illustration, we use our recently acquired data on amoeboid cell deformation, motivated by its direct implication in immune responses, bacterial invasion, and cancer metastasis.},

These mutations give rise to distinct alterations in normal splice site and exon recognition, such as unusual 3' splice site preferences, that likely contribute to tumorigenesis. METHODS: We analyzed genome-wide patterns of RNA splicing across 805 matched tumor and normal control samples from 16 distinct cancer types to identify signals of abnormal cancer-associated splicing. RESULTS: We found that abnormal RNA splicing, typified by widespread intron retention, is common across cancers even in the absence of mutations directly affecting the RNA splicing machinery. Almost all liquid and solid cancer types exhibited frequent retention of both alternative and constitutive introns relative to control normal tissues. The sole exception was breast cancer, where intron retention typified adjacent normal rather than cancer tissue. Different introns were preferentially retained in specific cancer types, although a small subset of introns enriched for genes encoding RNA splicing and export factors exhibited frequent retention across diverse cancers. The extent of intron retention correlated with the presence of IDH1 and IDH2 mutations in acute myeloid leukemia and across molecular subtypes in breast cancer. Many introns that were preferentially retained in primary cancers were present at high levels in the cytoplasmic mRNA pools of cancer cell lines. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that abnormal RNA splicing is a common characteristic of cancers even in the absence of mutational insults to the splicing machinery, and suggest that intron-containing mRNAs contribute to the transcriptional diversity of many cancers.},

  abstract = {Notions of community quality underlie network clustering. While studies surrounding network clustering are increasingly common, a precise understanding of the realtionship between different cluster quality metrics is unknown. In this paper, we examine the relationship between stand-alone cluster quality metrics and information recovery metrics through a rigorous analysis of four widely-used network clustering algorithms -- Louvain, Infomap, label propagation, and smart local moving. We consider the stand-alone quality metrics of modularity, conductance, and coverage, and we consider the information recovery metrics of adjusted Rand score, normalized mutual information, and a variant of normalized mutual information used in previous work. Our study includes both synthetic graphs and empirical data sets of sizes varying from 1,000 to 1,000,000 nodes. We find significant differences among the results of the different cluster quality metrics. For example, clustering algorithms can return a value of 0.4 out of 1 on modularity but score 0 out of 1 on information recovery. We find conductance, though imperfect, to be the stand-alone quality metric that best indicates performance on information recovery metrics. Our study shows that the variant of normalized mutual information used in previous work cannot be assumed to differ only slightly from traditional normalized mutual information. Smart local moving is the best performing algorithm in our study, but discrepancies between cluster evaluation metrics prevent us from declaring it absolutely superior. Louvain performed better than Infomap in nearly all the tests in our study, contradicting the results of previous work in which Infomap was superior to Louvain. We find that although label propagation performs poorly when clusters are less clearly defined, it scales efficiently and accurately to large graphs with well-defined clusters.},

  abstract = {Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is an autosomal recessive neurological disorder caused by mutations in the ATM gene. Classical splicing mutations (type I) delete entire exons during pre-mRNA splicing. In this report, we describe nine examples of nonclassical splicing mutations in 12 A-T patients and compare cDNA changes to estimates of splice junction strengths based on maximum entropy modeling. These mutations fall into three categories: pseudoexon insertions (type II), single nucleotide changes within the exon (type III), and intronic changes that disrupt the conserved 3' splice sequence and lead to partial exon deletion (type IV). Four patients with a previously reported type II (pseudoexon) mutation all shared a common founder haplotype. Three patients with apparent missense or silent mutations actually had type III aberrant splicing and partial deletion of an exon. Five patients had type IV mutations that could have been misinterpreted as classical splicing mutations. Instead, their mutations disrupt a splice site and use another AG splice site located nearby within the exon; they lead to partial deletions at the beginning of exons. These nonclassical splicing mutations create frameshifts that result in premature termination codons. Without screening cDNA or using accurate models of splice site strength, the consequences of these genomic mutations cannot be reliably predicted. This may lead to further misinterpretation of genotype-phenotype correlations and may subsequently impact upon gene-based therapeutic approaches.},

We show that seqFISH+ can image mRNAs for 10,000 genes in single cells-with high accuracy and sub-diffraction-limit resolution-in the cortex, subventricular zone and olfactory bulb of mouse brain, using a standard confocal microscope. The transcriptome-level profiling of seqFISH+ allows unbiased identification of cell classes and their spatial organization in tissues.

Here, we overview both widely applied and newer statistical methods for GWAS meta-analysis, including issues of interpretation and assessment of sources of heterogeneity. We also discuss extensions of these meta-analysis methods to complex data. Where possible, we provide guidelines for researchers who are planning to use these methods. Furthermore, we address special issues that may arise for meta-analysis of sequencing data and rare variants. Finally, we discuss challenges and solutions surrounding the goals of making meta-analysis data publicly available and building powerful consortia.},

The transcriptional state of each cell, however, reflects a variety of biological factors, including persistent cell-type specific regulatory configurations, transient processes such as cell cycle, local metabolic demands, and extracellular signals. Depending on the biological setting, all such aspects of transcriptional heterogeneity can be of potential interest, but detecting complex heterogeneity structure from inherently uncertain single-cell data presents analytical challenges. We developed PAGODA to resolve multiple, potentially overlapping aspects of transcriptional heterogeneity by identifying known pathways or novel gene sets that show significant excess of coordinated variability among the measured cells. We demonstrate that PAGODA effectively recovers the subpopulations and their corresponding functional characteristics in a variety of single-cell samples, and use it to characterize transcriptional diversity of neuronal progenitors in the developing mouse cortex},

  abstract = {Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-based therapies have offered promising treatments against several disorders. However, the clinical efficacy and consistency remain underdeveloped. Singlecell and bulk molecular analyses have provided considerable heterogeneity of MSCs due to origin, expansion, and microenvironment. Image-based cellular omics methods elucidate ultimate variability in stem cell colonies, otherwise masked by bulk omics approaches. Here, we present a spatially resolved Gene Neighborhood Network (spaGNN) method to produce transcriptional density maps and analyze neighboring RNA distributions in single human MSCs and chondrocytes cultured on 2D collagen-coated substrates. This proposed strategy provides cell classification based on subcellular spatial features and gene neighborhood networks. Machine learning-based clustering of resultant data yields subcellular density classes of 20-plex biomarkers containing diverse transcript and protein features. The spaGNN reveals tissue-source-specific MSC transcription and spatial distribution characteristics. Multiplexed spaGNN analysis allows for rapid examination of spatially resolved subcellular features and activities in a broad range of cells used in pre-clinical and clinical research.},

New strategies for detecting spatial gene expression patterns are emerging, and spatially resolved transcriptomic data are accumulating rapidly. However, it is not convenient for biologists to exploit these data due to the diversity of strategies and complexity in data analysis. Here, we present SpatialDB, the first manually curated database for spatially resolved transcriptomic techniques and datasets. The current version of SpatialDB contains 24 datasets (305 subdatasets) from 5 species generated by 8 spatially resolved transcriptomic techniques. SpatialDB provides a user-friendly web interface for visualization and comparison of spatially resolved transcriptomic data. To further explore these data, SpatialDB also provides spatially variable genes and their functional enrichment annotation. SpatialDB offers a repository for research community to investigate the spatial cellular structure of tissues, and may bring new insights into understanding the cellular microenvironment in disease.

  abstract = {Uncovering signaling links or cascades among proteins that potentially regulate tumor development and drug response is one of the most critical and challenging tasks in cancer molecular biology. Inhibition of the targets on the core signaling cascades can be effective as novel cancer treatment regimens. However, signaling cascades inference remains an open problem, and there is a lack of effective computational models. The widely used gene co-expression network (no-direct signaling cascades) and shortest-path based protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis (with too many interactions, and did not consider the sparsity of signaling cascades) were not specifically designed to predict the direct and sparse signaling cascades. To resolve the challenges, we proposed a novel deep learning model, deepSignalingLinkNet, to predict signaling cascades by integrating transcriptomics data and copy number data of a large set of cancer samples with the protein-protein interactions (PPIs) via a novel deep graph neural network model. Different from the existing models, the proposed deep learning model was trained using the curated KEGG signaling pathways to identify the informative omics and PPI topology features in the data-driven manner to predict the potential signaling cascades. The validation results indicated the feasibility of signaling cascade prediction using the proposed deep learning models. Moreover, the trained model can potentially predict the signaling cascades among the new proteins by transferring the learned patterns on the curated signaling pathways.

These non-coding RNAs can be divided into two main classes according to their length: short non-coding RNAs, such as microRNAs (miRNAs), and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). The lncRNAs in association with other molecules can coordinate several physiological processes and their dysfunction may impact in several pathologies, including cancer and infectious diseases. They can control the flux of genetic information, such as chromosome structure modulation, transcription, splicing, messenger RNA (mRNA) stability, mRNA availability, and post-translational modifications. Long non-coding RNAs present interaction domains for DNA, mRNAs, miRNAs, and proteins, depending on both sequence and secondary structure. The advent of new generation sequencing has provided evidences of putative lncRNAs existence; however, the analysis of transcriptomes for their functional characterization remains a challenge. Here, we review some important aspects of lncRNA biology, focusing on their role as regulatory elements in gene expression modulation during physiological and disease processes, with implications in host and pathogens physiology, and their role in immune response modulation.},

  abstract = {The identification of RNAs that are not translated into proteins was an important breakthrough, defining the diversity of molecules involved in eukaryotic regulation of gene expression. These non-coding RNAs can be divided into two main classes according to their length: short non-coding RNAs, such as microRNAs (miRNAs), and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). The lncRNAs in association with other molecules can coordinate several physiological processes and their dysfunction may impact in several pathologies, including cancer and infectious diseases. They can control the flux of genetic information, such as chromosome structure modulation, transcription, splicing, messenger RNA (mRNA) stability, mRNA availability, and post-translational modifications. Long non-coding RNAs present interaction domains for DNA, mRNAs, miRNAs, and proteins, depending on both sequence and secondary structure. The advent of new generation sequencing has provided evidences of putative lncRNAs existence; however, the analysis of transcriptomes for their functional characterization remains a challenge. Here, we review some important aspects of lncRNA biology, focusing on their role as regulatory elements in gene expression modulation during physiological and disease processes, with implications in host and pathogens physiology, and their role in immune response modulation.},

  abstract = {A phylogeny is a tree representation of the evolutionary history of a set of taxa (organisms, biological sequences, populations, or languages). Thus, phylogeny construction is among the basic computational problems in biology and linguistics. We will be concerned here with taxa described by the states they exhibit on a set of characters. A sample data set and a phylogeny for it (both adapted from [41]) are shown in Figure 1. The data is binary and in matrix form, rows are indexed by taxa and columns by characters. Entry (i, j) is ``1'' if taxon i has character j and it is ``0'' if the character is absent. The phylogeny shown is rooted and assumes that the taxa descend from a common ancestor where all characters are absent. Points at which characters emerge are indicated by labeled bars. 1}

  abstract = {The genetic impact associated to the Neolithic spread in Europe has been widely debated over the last 20 years. Within this context, ancient DNA studies have provided a more reliable picture by directly analyzing the protagonist populations at different regions in Europe. However, the lack of available data from the original Near Eastern farmers has limited the achieved conclusions, preventing the formulation of continental models of Neolithic expansion. Here we address this issue by presenting mitochondrial DNA data of the original Near-Eastern Neolithic communities with the aim of providing the adequate background for the interpretation of Neolithic genetic data from European samples. Sixty-three skeletons from the Pre Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB) sites of Tell Halula, Tell Ramad and Dja'de El Mughara dating between 8,700-6,600 cal. B.C. were analyzed, and 15 validated mitochondrial DNA profiles were recovered. In order to estimate the demographic contribution of the first farmers to both Central European and Western Mediterranean Neolithic cultures, haplotype and haplogroup diversities in the PPNB sample were compared using phylogeographic and population genetic analyses to available ancient DNA data from human remains belonging to the Linearbandkeramik-Alf\"oldi Vonaldiszes Ker\'amia and Cardial/Epicardial cultures. We also searched for possible signatures of the original Neolithic expansion over the modern Near Eastern and South European genetic pools, and tried to infer possible routes of expansion by comparing the obtained results to a database of 60 modern populations from both regions. Comparisons performed among the 3 ancient datasets allowed us to identify K and N-derived mitochondrial DNA haplogroups as potential markers of the Neolithic expansion, whose genetic signature would have reached both the Iberian coasts and the Central European plain. Moreover, the observed genetic affinities between the PPNB samples and the modern populations of Cyprus and Crete seem to suggest that the Neolithic was first introduced into Europe through pioneer seafaring colonization.},

Such effects have been proposed to result from a simple antisense mechanism that depends on hybridization between the injected RNA and endogenous messenger RNA transcripts. RNA interference has been used in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to manipulate gene expression. Here we investigate the requirements for structure and delivery of the interfering RNA. To our surprise, we found that double-stranded RNA was substantially more effective at producing interference than was either strand individually. After injection into adult animals, purified single strands had at most a modest effect, whereas double-stranded mixtures caused potent and specific interference. The effects of this interference were evident in both the injected animals and their progeny. Only a few molecules of injected double-stranded RNA were required per affected cell, arguing against stochiometric interference with endogenous mRNA and suggesting that there could be a catalytic or amplification component in the interference process.},

These results expose the large dynamic range of transcript-isoform-specific translational control, identify isoform-specific sequences that control protein output in human cells, and demonstrate that transcript isoform diversity must be considered when relating RNA and protein levels.           ,              To produce a protein, a gene's DNA is first copied to make molecules of messenger RNA (mRNA). The mRNAs pass through a molecular machine known as the ribosome, which translates the genetic code to make a protein. Not all of an mRNA is translated to make a protein; the ``untranslated'' regions play crucial roles in regulating how much of the protein is produced.             In animals, plants and other eukaryotes, many mRNAs are made up of small pieces that are ``spliced'' together. During this process, proteins are deposited on the mRNA to mark the splice junctions, which are then cleared when the mRNA is translated. Many different mRNAs can be produced from the same gene by splicing different combinations of RNA pieces. Each of these mRNA ``isoforms'' can, in principle, contain a unique set of features that control its translation. Hence each mRNA isoform can be translated differently so that different amounts of the corresponding protein product are produced. However, the relationship between the variety of isoforms and the control of translation is complex and not well understood.             To address these questions, Floor and Doudna measured the translation of over 60,000 mRNA isoforms made from almost 14,000 human genes. The experiments show that untranslated regions at the end of the mRNA (known as the 3{${'}$} end) strongly influence translation, even if the protein coding regions remain the same. Furthermore, the data showed that mRNAs with more splice junctions are translated better, implying an mRNA has some sort of memory of how many junctions it had even after the protein markers have been cleared.             Next, Floor and Doudna inserted regulatory sequences from differently translated isoforms into an unrelated ``reporter'' gene. This dramatically changed the amount of protein produced from the reporter gene, in a manner predicted by the earlier experiments. Untranslated regions at the beginning of the mRNAs (known as the 5{${'}$} end) controlled the amount of protein produced from the reporter consistently across different types of cells from the body. On the other hand, the 3{${'}$} regions can tune the level of protein production in particular types of cells.             Floor and Doudna's findings demonstrate that differences between mRNA isoforms of a gene can have a big effect on the level of protein production. Changes in the types of mRNA made from a gene are often associated with human diseases, and these findings suggest one reason why. Additionally, the ability to engineer translation of an mRNA using the data is likely to aid the development of mRNA-based therapies.},

By subdividing the genome into discrete regulatory units, TADs restrict the contacts that enhancers establish with their target genes. However, the mechanisms that underlie partitioning of the genome into TADs remain poorly understood. Here we show by chromosome conformation capture (capture Hi-C and 4C-seq methods) that genomic duplications in patient cells and genetically modified mice can result in the formation of new chromatin domains (neo-TADs) and that this process determines their molecular pathology. Duplications of non-coding DNA within the mouse Sox9 TAD (intra-TAD) that cause female to male sex reversal in humans, showed increased contact of the duplicated regions within the TAD, but no change in the overall TAD structure. In contrast, overlapping duplications that extended over the next boundary into the neighbouring TAD (inter-TAD), resulted in the formation of a new chromatin domain (neo-TAD) that was isolated from the rest of the genome. As a consequence of this insulation, inter-TAD duplications had no phenotypic effect. However, incorporation of the next flanking gene, Kcnj2, in the neo-TAD resulted in ectopic contacts of Kcnj2 with the duplicated part of the Sox9 regulatory region, consecutive misexpression of Kcnj2, and a limb malformation phenotype. Our findings provide evidence that TADs are genomic regulatory units with a high degree of internal stability that can be sculptured by structural genomic variations. This process is important for the interpretation of copy number variations, as these variations are routinely detected in diagnostic tests for genetic disease and cancer. This finding also has relevance in an evolutionary setting because copy-number differences are thought to have a crucial role in the evolution of genome complexity.},

Although this approach is technology agnostic, in cancer there is a tendency to make precision medicine synonymous with genomics. However, genome-based cancer therapeutic matching is limited by incomplete biological understanding of the relationship between phenotype and cancer genotype. This limitation can be addressed by functional testing of live patient tumour cells exposed to potential therapies.

  abstract = {For many RNA molecules, the secondary structure is essential for the correct function of the RNA. Predicting RNA secondary structure from nucleotide sequences is a long-standing problem in genomics, but the prediction performance has reached a plateau over time. Traditional RNA secondary structure prediction algorithms are primarily based on thermodynamic models through free energy minimization, which imposes strong prior assumptions and is slow to run. Here, we propose a deep learningbased method, called UFold, for RNA secondary structure prediction, trained directly on annotated data and base-pairing rules. UFold proposes a novel image-like representation of RNA sequences, which can be efficiently processed by Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs). We benchmark the performance of UFold on both within- and cross-family RNA datasets. It significantly outperforms previous methods on within-family datasets, while achieving a similar performance as the traditional methods when trained and tested on distinct RNA families. UFold is also able to predict pseudoknots accurately. Its prediction is fast with an inference time of about 160 ms per sequence up to 1500 bp in length. An online web server running UFold is available at https://ufold.ics.uci.edu. Code is available at https: //github.com/uci-cbcl/UFold.},

  abstract = {The nucleoplasm is not homogenous; it consists of many types of nuclear bodies, also known as nuclear domains or nuclear subcompartments. These selforganizing structures gather machinery involved in various nuclear activities. Nuclear speckles (NSs) or splicing speckles, also called interchromatin granule clusters, were discovered as sites for splicing factor storage and modification. Further studies on transcription and mRNA maturation and export revealed a more general role for splicing speckles in RNA metabolism. Here, we discuss the functional implications of the localization of numerous proteins crucial for epigenetic regulation, chromatin organization, DNA repair and RNA modification to nuclear speckles. We highlight recent advances suggesting that NSs facilitate integrated regulation of gene expression. In addition, we consider the influence of abundant regulatory and signaling proteins, i.e. protein kinases and proteins involved in protein ubiquitination, phosphoinositide signaling and nucleoskeletal organization, on pre-mRNA synthesis and maturation. While many of these regulatory proteins act within NSs, direct evidence for mRNA metabolism events occurring in NSs is still lacking. NSs contribute to numerous human diseases, including cancers and viral infections. In addition, recent data have demonstrated close relationships between these structures and the development of neurological disorders.},

  abstract = {Alternative pre-mRNA splicing is a tightly controlled process conducted by the spliceosome, with the assistance of several regulators, resulting in the expression of different transcript isoforms from the same gene and increasing both transcriptome and proteome complexity. The differences between alternative isoforms may be subtle but enough to change the function or localization of the translated proteins. A fine control of the isoform balance is, therefore, needed throughout developmental stages and adult tissues or physiological conditions and it does not come as a surprise that several diseases are caused by its deregulation. In this review, we aim to bring the splicing machinery on stage and raise the curtain on its mechanisms and regulation throughout several systems and tissues of the human body, from neurodevelopment to the interactions with the human microbiome. We discuss, on one hand, the essential role of alternative splicing in assuring tissue function, diversity, and swiftness of response in these systems or tissues, and on the other hand, what goes wrong when its regulatory mechanisms fail. We also focus on the possibilities that splicing modulation therapies open for the future of personalized medicine, along with the leading techniques in this field. The final act of the spliceosome, however, is yet to be fully revealed, as more knowledge is needed regarding the complex regulatory network that coordinates alternative splicing and how its dysfunction leads to disease.},

  abstract = {The prediction of transcription factor (TF) activities from the gene expression of their targets (i.e., TF regulon) is becoming a widely used approach to characterize the functional status of transcriptional regulatory circuits. Several strategies and data sets have been proposed to link the target genes likely regulated by a TF, each one providing a different level of evidence. The most established ones are (1) manually curated repositories, (2) interactions derived from ChIP-seq binding data, (3) in silico prediction of TF binding on gene promoters, and (4) reverse-engineered regulons from large gene expression data sets. However, it is not known how these different sources of regulons affect the TF activity estimations and, thereby, downstream analysis and interpretation. Here we compared the accuracy and biases of these strategies to define human TF regulons by means of their ability to predict changes in TF activities in three reference benchmark data sets. We assembled a collection of TF-target interactions for 1541 human TFs and evaluated how different molecular and regulatory properties of the TFs, such as the DNA-binding domain, specificities, or mode of interaction with the chromatin, affect the predictions of TF activity. We assessed their coverage and found little overlap on the regulons derived from each strategy and better performance by literature-curated information followed by ChIP-seq data. We provide an integrated resource of all TF-target interactions derived through these strategies, with confidence scores, as a resource for enhanced prediction of TF activities.},

  abstract = {The microtubule minus-end-directed motility of cytoplasmic dynein 1 (dynein), arguably the most complex and versatile cytoskeletal motor, is harnessed for diverse functions, such as long-range organelle transport in neuronal axons and spindle assembly in dividing cells. The versatility of dynein raises a number of intriguing questions, including how is dynein recruited to its diverse cargo, how is recruitment coupled to activation of the motor, how is motility regulated to meet different requirements for force production and how does dynein coordinate its activity with that of other microtubuleassociated proteins (MAPs) present on the same cargo. Here, these questions will be discussed in the context of dynein at the kinetochore, the supramolecular protein structure that connects segregating chromosomes to spindle microtubules in dividing cells. As the first kinetochore-localized MAP described, dynein has intrigued cell biologists for more than three decades. The first part of this Review summarizes current knowledge about how kinetochore dynein contributes to efficient and accurate spindle assembly, and the second part describes the underlying molecular mechanisms and highlights emerging commonalities with dynein regulation at other subcellular sites.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a transformative technology, allowing global transcriptomes of individual cells to be profiled with high accuracy. An essential task in scRNA-seq data analysis is the identification of cell types from complex samples or tissues profiled in an experiment. To this end, clustering has become a key computational technique for grouping cells based on their transcriptome profiles, enabling subsequent cell type identification from each cluster of cells. Due to the high feature-dimensionality of the transcriptome (i.e. the large number of measured genes in each cell) and because only a small fraction of genes are cell type-specific and therefore informative for generating cell type-specific clusters, clustering directly on the original feature/gene dimension may lead to uninformative clusters and hinder correct cell type identification. RESULTS: Here, we propose an autoencoder-based cluster ensemble framework in which we first take random subspace projections from the data, then compress each random projection to a low-dimensional space using an autoencoder artificial neural network, and finally apply ensemble clustering across all encoded datasets to generate clusters of cells. We employ four evaluation metrics to benchmark clustering performance and our experiments demonstrate that the proposed autoencoder-based cluster ensemble can lead to substantially improved cell type-specific clusters when applied with both the standard k-means clustering algorithm and a state-of-the-art kernel-based clustering algorithm (SIMLR) designed specifically for scRNA-seq data. Compared to directly using these clustering algorithms on the original datasets, the performance improvement in some cases is up to 100\%, depending on the evaluation metric used. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the proposed framework can facilitate more accurate cell type identification as well as other downstream analyses. The code for creating the proposed autoencoder-based cluster ensemble framework is freely available from https://github.com/gedcom/scCCESS.},

As more data is produced there is an increasing need to integrate diverse datasets and better analyse underutilised data to gain biological insights. However, analysis of single cell RNA-seq data is challenging due to biological and technical noise which not only varies between laboratories but also between batches. Here for the first time, we apply a new generative deep learning approach called Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to biological data. We apply GANs to epidermal, neural and hematopoietic scRNA-seq data spanning different labs and experimental protocols. We show that it is possible to integrate diverse scRNA-seq datasets and in doing so, our generative model is able to simulate realistic scRNA-seq data that covers the full diversity of cell types. In contrast to many machine-learning approaches, we are able to interpret internal parameters in a biologically meaningful manner. Using our generative model we are able to obtain a universal representation of epidermal differentiation and use this to predict the effect of cell state perturbations on gene expression at high time-resolution. We show that our trained neural networks identify biological state-determining genes and through analysis of these networks we can obtain inferred gene regulatory relationships.

The fact that they tend not to identify more than a fraction of the specific causal loci has led to divergence of opinion over whether most of the variance is hidden as numerous rare variants of large effect or as common variants of very small effect. Here I review 20 arguments for and against each of these models of the genetic basis of complex traits and conclude that both classes of effect can be readily reconciled.},

  abstract = {Alterations in global mRNA decay broadly impact multiple stages of gene expression, although signals that connect these processes are incompletely defined. Here, we used tandem mass tag labeling coupled with mass spectrometry to reveal that changing the mRNA decay landscape, as frequently occurs during viral infection, results in subcellular redistribution of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) in human cells. Accelerating Xrn1-dependent mRNA decay through expression of a gammaherpesviral endonuclease drove nuclear translocation of many RBPs, including poly(A) tail-associated proteins. Conversely, cells lacking Xrn1 exhibited changes in the localization or abundance of numerous factors linked to mRNA turnover. Using these data, we uncovered a new role for relocalized cytoplasmic poly(A) binding protein in repressing recruitment of TATA binding protein and RNA polymerase II to promoters. Collectively, our results show that changes in cytoplasmic mRNA decay can directly impact protein localization, providing a mechanism to connect seemingly distal stages of gene expression.           ,              The nucleus of a cell harbors DNA, which contains all information needed to build an organism. The instructions are stored as a genetic code that serves as a blueprint for making proteins \textendash{} molecules that are important for almost every process in the body \textendash{} and to assemble cells. But first, the code on the DNA needs to be translated with the help of a `middle man', known as messenger RNA. These molecules carry information to other parts of the cell, wherever it is needed.             Messenger RNA is produced in the nucleus of a cell, and then exported into the material within a cell, called the cytoplasm, as a template to produce proteins. Once this process has finished, the template is destroyed. The rate at which the messenger RNA is made affects the flow of genetic information.             However, recent evidence suggests that the speed at which messenger RNA is destroyed in the cytoplasm can influence how much of it is made in the nucleus, i.e., if high levels of RNA are destroyed, the production is stopped. For example, it has been shown that certain viruses possess proteins that speed up the destruction of messenger RNA to gain control over the host cell.             Here, Gilbertson et al. wanted to find out more about how the breakdown of RNA can signal the nucleus to stop producing these molecules. Messenger RNAs are coated with proteins, which are released when the RNA is destroyed. To test if some of those proteins travel back to the nucleus to influence the production of messenger RNA, proteins in human cells grown in the laboratory were labeled with specific trackers. RNA destruction was induced, in a way that is similar to what happens during a virus attack. The experiments revealed that many RNA-binding proteins indeed return to the nucleus when RNA is destroyed. One of these proteins, named cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein, played a key role in transmitting the signal between the cytoplasm and the nucleus to control the production messenger RNA.             The amount of messenger RNA can change in many ways throughout the life of a cell. For example, viral infections can lower it and limit the growth and health of cells. A drop in these molecules could act as an early warning of ill health in cells and trigger responses in the nucleus. This new link between messenger RNA destruction and production may help to shed new light on how cells use different signals to control the production of their own genes while restricting pathogens from taking over. A next step will be to determine how these signals communicate with the RNA production machinery in the nucleus and how certain viruses can subvert this process to activate their own genes.},

  abstract = {RNA molecules are localized to specific subcellular regions through interactions between RNA regulatory elements and RNA binding proteins (RBPs). Generally, our knowledge of the mechanistic details behind the localization of a given RNA is restricted to a particular cell type. Here, we show that RNA/RBP interactions that regulate RNA localization in one cell type predictably regulate localization in other cell types with vastly different morphologies. To determine transcriptome-w\- ide RNA spatial distributions across the apicobasal axis of human intestinal epithelial cells, we used our recently developed RNA proximity labeling technique, Halo-\-seq. We found that mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins (RP mRNAs) were strongly localized to the basal pole of these cells. Using reporter transcripts and single-\-molecule RNA FISH, we found that pyrimidine-r\-ich motifs in the 5{${'}$} UTRs of RP mRNAs were sufficient to drive basal RNA localization. Interestingly, the same motifs were also sufficient to drive RNA localization to the neurites of mouse neuronal cells. In both cell types, the regulatory activity of this motif was dependent on it being in the 5{${'}$} UTR of the transcript, was abolished upon perturbation of the RNA-b\- inding protein LARP1, and was reduced upon inhibition of kinesin-\-1. To extend these findings, we compared subcellular RNAseq data from neuronal and epithelial cells. We found that the basal compartment of epithelial cells and the projections of neuronal cells were enriched for highly similar sets of RNAs, indicating that broadly similar mechanisms may be transporting RNAs to these morphologically distinct locations. These findings identify the first RNA element known to regulate RNA localization across the apicobasal axis of epithelial cells, establish LARP1 as an RNA localization regulator, and demonstrate that RNA localization mechanisms cut across cell morphologies.},

  abstract = {149Background: MHC-1 molecules present intracellular peptides on the surface of tumor cells for recognition by CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells. Cancers with a high tumor mutational burden (TMB) are more likely to respond to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) due to the increased chance of having a mutated peptide presented by MHC-1. However, the interaction between TMB and patient-specific MHC-1 and ICB response is unknown. Methods: We analyzed 83 patients with diverse solid tumors treated with ICB for TMB and MHC-1 (tissue next generation sequencing (NGS) (Foundation Medicine)). TMB low vs high were defined as {$<$}20 vs \textbackslash geq20 mut/mb, respectively. Patient Harmonic-mean Best Rank (PHBR) (Marty et al. 2018) scores the ability of the MHC-I of an individual to bind and present a specific missense mutation. Patients were assigned the PHBR of their best presented missense driver mutation. PHBR low (strong presentation) vs high (weak presentation) were defined as {$<$}1.01 vs \textbackslash geq1.01 respectively (cutoff per a receiver operator curve). Overall response rate (ORR) (includes stable disease for \textbackslash geq6 months) was determined (RECIST criteria). Results: The ORR, PFS, and OS for patients treated with ICB with PHBR low vs. high tumors was 72\% vs 28\% (P = 0.01), 6.3 vs 4.1 months (P = 0.03), and 37.1 vs 13.9 months (P = 0.25), respectively. The ORR, PFS, and OS for TMB low vs high was 36\% vs 67\% (P = 0.02), 4.3 vs 14.1 months (P = 0.01), and 12.0 months vs not reached (P = 0.03), respectively. The ORR, PFS, and OS for TMB high/PHBR high vs TMB high/PHBR low was 38\% vs 85\% (P {$<$} 0.01), 3.9 vs 26.8 months (P {$<$}0.01), and 17.1 vs not reached (P = 0.02), respectively Conclusions: MHC-1 genotype and the ability to present driver neo-antigens predicts which patients with TMB high will respond to ICB.PHBR and TMB.GroupORRPOR [95\% CI]PFS (months)PHR [95\% CI]OS (months)PHR [95\% CI]TMB low/PHBR high (N = 26)6 (23\%)ReferenceReference4.3ReferenceReference11.1ReferenceReferenceTMB low/PHBR low (N = 21)14 (47\%)0.391.87 [0.59-6.49]4.50.310.74 [0.41-1.33]12.90.61470.75 [0.38-1.54]TMB high/PHBR high (N = 8)3 (38\%)0.652.00 [0.42-9.23]3.90.800.89 [0.37-2.12]17.10.60791.33 [0.48-3.70]TMB high/PHBR low (N = 13)11 (85\%){$<$} 0.0118.33 [2.97-91.48]26.8{$<$}0.010.25 [0.12-0.51]Not reached (median f/u 22.4 mos)0.023.69 [1.45-9.4]}

  abstract = {Understanding the spatial organization of tissues is of critical importance for both basic and translational research. While recent advances in tissue imaging are opening an exciting new window into the biology of human tissues, interpreting the data that they create is a significant computational challenge. Cell segmentation, the task of uniquely identifying each cell in an image, remains a substantial barrier for tissue imaging, as existing approaches are inaccurate or require a substantial amount of manual curation to yield useful results. Here, we addressed the problem of cell segmentation in tissue imaging data through largescale data annotation and deep learning. We constructed TissueNet, an image dataset containing {$>$}1 million paired whole-cell and nuclear annotations for tissue images from nine organs and six imaging platforms. We created Mesmer, a deep learning-enabled segmentation algorithm trained on TissueNet that performs nuclear and whole-cell segmentation in tissue imaging data. We demonstrated that Mesmer has better speed and accuracy than previous methods, generalizes to the full diversity of tissue types and imaging platforms in TissueNet, and achieves human-level performance for whole-cell segmentation. Mesmer enabled the automated extraction of key cellular features, such as subcellular localization of protein signal, which was challenging with previous approaches. We further showed that Mesmer could be adapted to harness cell lineage information present in highly multiplexed datasets. We used this enhanced version to quantify cell morphology changes during human gestation. All underlying code and models are released with permissive licenses as a community resource.},

While protein subcellular localization prediction is a well-established research field, lncRNA localization prediction is a novel research problem. We developed DeepLncRNA, a deep learning algorithm which predicts lncRNA subcellular localization directly from lncRNA transcript sequences. We analyzed 93 strand-specific RNA-seq samples of nuclear and cytosolic fractions from multiple cell types to identify differentially localized lncRNAs. We then extracted sequence-based features from the lncRNAs to construct our DeepLncRNA model, which achieved an accuracy of 72.4\%, sensitivity of 83\%, specificity of 62.4\% and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.787.

  abstract = {Point cloud learning has lately attracted increasing attention due to its wide applications in many areas, such as computer vision, autonomous driving, and robotics. As a dominating technique in AI, deep learning has been successfully used to solve various 2D vision problems. However, deep learning on point clouds is still in its infancy due to the unique challenges faced by the processing of point clouds with deep neural networks. Recently, deep learning on point clouds has become even thriving, with numerous methods being proposed to address different problems in this area. To stimulate future research, this paper presents a comprehensive review of recent progress in deep learning methods for point clouds. It covers three major tasks, including 3D shape classification, 3D object detection and tracking, and 3D point cloud segmentation. It also presents comparative results on several publicly available datasets, together with insightful observations and inspiring future research directions.},

  abstract = {Full-length RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) has been applied to bulk tissue, cell lines and sorted cells to characterize transcriptomes, but applying this technology to single cells has proven to be difficult, with less than ten single-cell transcriptomes having been analyzed thus far. Although single splicing events have been described for \textbackslash leq200 single cells with statistical confidence, full-length mRNA analyses for hundreds of cells have not been reported. Single-cell short-read 3' sequencing enables the identification of cellular subtypes, but full-length mRNA isoforms for these cell types cannot be profiled. We developed a method that starts with bulk tissue and identifies single-cell types and their full-length RNA isoforms without fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Using single-cell isoform RNA-Seq (ScISOr-Seq), we identified RNA isoforms in neurons, astrocytes, microglia, and cell subtypes such as Purkinje and Granule cells, and cell-type-specific combination patterns of distant splice sites. We used ScISOr-Seq to improve genome annotation in mouse Gencode version 10 by determining the cell-type-specific expression of 18,173 known and 16,872 novel isoforms.},

Various methods have been developed in recent years to achieve spatially resolved multiplexed measurements of the abundance of large sets of mRNAs or proteins in biological samples. These technologies have brought the promise that, through large-scale efforts, all functionally relevant cell types of an organism will emerge from such multiplexed data in an unbiased manner. Furthermore, these cell types will be able to be mapped within their physical context within a tissue.                                         RATIONALE               The involvement of an mRNA or protein (state) in cellular function depends on its specific intracellular location and interaction with other molecules and cellular structures. Moreover, the phenotype of an individual cell is determined by the functional state, abundance, morphology, and turnover of its organelles and cytoskeletal structures. To functionally interpret molecular multiplexed information, such measurements will thus need to resolve the intracellular length scale.                                         RESULTS                                We report a simple, robust, and nondegrading protocol that achieves 40-plex protein staining in the same biological sample using off-the-shelf antibodies called iterative indirect immunofluorescence imaging (4i). In conjunction with high-throughput automated microscopy and computer vision, 4i allows highly reproducible multiplexed measurements from surface areas of several mm                 2                 subsampled by pixels of 165 nm by 165 nm. This approach simultaneously captures functionally relevant properties that emerge at the cell population, cellular, and intracellular level. 4i can thus quantify the influence of local cell crowding on protein abundance, the effect of cell cycle position on protein phosphorylation, patterns of protein subcompartmentalization, and organelle morphology all in the same single cell and across thousands of cells.                              We developed a data-driven computer vision approach that generates multiplexed protein maps (MPMs). MPMs comprehensively quantify intracellular protein composition with high spatial detail in large numbers of single cells. They are not confounded by the specific relative geometry and orientation of an individual cell. Thus, MPMs allow systematic comparisons of subcellular spatial protein distribution between single cells that experience different cell cycle states, microenvironments, growth conditions, or exposure to drugs. Using the example of subcellular relocalization of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor upon exposure to EGF, we demonstrate that MPMs allow the systematic definition of cellular states undetectable by multiplexed whole-cell measurements. The findings are functionally relevant and can be connected to multiple molecular and phenotypic properties apparent at the cellular and cell population scale.                                         CONCLUSION               By preventing photocrosslinking during imaging, 4i enables multiplexed immunofluorescence with off-the-shelf antibodies, both in small-scale and high-throughput experiments. 4i datasets cover multiple length scales, eliminating the need for extrapolation or inference in the interpretation of results. Integration of these length scales in one dataset reveals a richness of scale-crossing connections that current models of biological processes do not yet consider. These connections determine how gene expression is adapted to the cellular state, how a cell type is determined, how a pathological cellular phenotype emerges, or how a tumor cell responds to a drug.                                                   Iterative indirect immunofluorescence imaging (4i).                   4i obtains 40-plexed protein readouts at high spatial detail in thousands of cells with the use of off-the-shelf antibodies. Multiplexed protein maps derived from such images provide a comprehensive quantitative description of compartmentalized intracellular protein composition. These maps can identify new cellular states and allow quantitative comparisons of intracellular organization between single cells in different cell cycle states, microenvironments, and drug treatments.                                                                         ,              Obtaining highly multiplexed protein measurements across multiple length scales has enormous potential for biomedicine.

These maps can identify new cellular states and allow quantitative comparisons of intracellular organization between single cells in different cell cycle states, microenvironments, and drug treatments.                                                                         ,              Obtaining highly multiplexed protein measurements across multiple length scales has enormous potential for biomedicine. Here, we measured, by iterative indirect immunofluorescence imaging (4i), 40-plex protein readouts from biological samples at high-throughput from the millimeter to the nanometer scale. This approach simultaneously captures properties apparent at the population, cellular, and subcellular levels, including microenvironment, cell shape, and cell cycle state. It also captures the detailed morphology of organelles, cytoskeletal structures, nuclear subcompartments, and the fate of signaling receptors in thousands of single cells in situ. We used computer vision and systems biology approaches to achieve unsupervised comprehensive quantification of protein subcompartmentalization within various multicellular, cellular, and pharmacological contexts. Thus, highly multiplexed subcellular protein maps can be used to identify functionally relevant single-cell states.},

In situ sequencing (ISS) method based on padlock probes and rolling circle amplification has been used to spatially resolve gene transcripts in tissue sections of various origins. Here, we describe the next iteration of ISS, HybISS, hybridization-based in situ sequencing. Modifications in probe design allows for a new barcoding system via sequence-by-hybridization chemistry for improved spatial detection of RNA transcripts. Due to the amplification of probes, amplicons can be visualized with standard epifluorescence microscopes for high-throughput efficiency and the new sequencing chemistry removes limitations bound by sequence-by-ligation chemistry of ISS. HybISS design allows for increased flexibility and multiplexing, increased signal-to-noise, all without compromising throughput efficiency of imaging large fields of view. Moreover, the current protocol is demonstrated to work on human brain tissue samples, a source that has proven to be difficult to work with image-based spatial analysis techniques. Overall, HybISS technology works as a targeted amplification detection method for improved spatial transcriptomic visualization, and importantly, with an ease of implementation.},

However, cell fate specification and tissue patterning involve the interplay of biochemical and mechanical feedback. Here, we develop a computational framework that enables the joint statistical analysis of transcriptional and mechanical signals in the context of spatial transcriptomics. To illustrate the application and utility of the approach, we use spatial transcriptomics data from the developing mouse embryo to infer the forces acting on individual cells, and use these results to identify mechanical, morphometric, and gene expression signatures that are predictive of tissue compartment boundaries. In addition, we use geoadditive structural equation modeling to identify gene modules that predict the mechanical behavior of cells in an unbiased manner. This computational framework is easily generalized to other spatial profiling contexts, providing a generic scheme for exploring the interplay of biomolecular and mechanical cues in tissues.},

Advances in genetics and animal models are beginning to unearth an unexpected role of the immune system in disease onset and pathogenesis; however, the role of cytokines, growth factors, and other immune signaling pathways in disease pathogenesis is still being examined. Here we review recent genetic risk and genome-wide association studies and emerging mechanisms for three key immune pathways implicated in disease, the growth factor TGF-{$\beta$}, the complement cascade, and the extracellular receptor TREM2. These immune signaling pathways are important under both healthy and neurodegenerative conditions, and recent work has highlighted new functional aspects of their signaling. Finally, we assess future directions for immune-related research in neurodegeneration and potential avenues for immune-related therapies.},

  abstract = {iPSC-derived microglia offer a powerful tool to study microglial homeostasis and disease-associated inflammatory responses. Yet, microglia are highly sensitive to their environment, exhibiting transcriptomic deficiencies when kept in isolation from the brain. Furthermore, species-specific genetic variations demonstrate that rodent microglia fail to fully recapitulate the human condition. To address this, we developed an approach to study human microglia within a surrogate brain environment. Transplantation of iPSC-derived hematopoietic-progenitors into the postnatal brain of humanized, immune-deficient mice results in context-dependent differentiation into microglia and other CNS macrophages, acquisition of an ex vivo human microglial gene signature, and responsiveness to both acute and chronic insults. Most notably, transplanted microglia exhibit robust transcriptional responses to A{$\beta$}-plaques that only partially overlap with that of murine microglia, revealing new, human-specific A{$\beta$}-responsive genes. We therefore have demonstrated that this chimeric model provides a powerful new system to examine the in vivo function of patient-derived and genetically modified microglia.},

  abstract = {Cancer therapies with anthracyclines have been shown to induce cardiovascular complications. The aims of this study were to establish an in vitro induced pluripotent stem cell model (iPSC) of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity (ACT) from patients with an aggressive form of B-cell lymphoma and to examine whether doxorubicin (DOX)-treated ACT-iPSC cardiomyocytes (CM) can recapitulate the clinical features exhibited by patients, and thus help uncover a DOX-dependent pathomechanism. ACT-iPSC CM generated from individuals with \-CD20+ B-cell lymphoma who had received high doses of DOX and suffered cardiac dysfunction were studied and compared to control-iPSC CM from cancer survivors without cardiac symptoms. In cellular studies, ACT-iPSC CM were persistently more susceptible to DOX toxicity including augmented disorganized myofilament structure, changed mitochondrial shape, and increased apoptotic events. Consistently, ACT-iPSC CM and cardiac fibroblasts isolated from fibrotic human ACT myocardium exhibited higher DOX-dependent reactive oxygen species. In functional studies, C\- a2+ transient amplitude of ACT-iPSC CM was reduced compared to control cells, and diastolic sarcoplasmic reticulum \-Ca2+ leak was DOX-dependently increased. This could be explained by overactive CaMKII{$\delta$} in ACT CM. Together with DOX-dependent augmented proarrhythmic cellular triggers and prolonged action potentials in ACT CM, this suggests a cellular link to arrhythmogenic events and contractile dysfunction especially found in ACT engineered human myocardium. CamKII{$\delta$} inhibition prevented proarrhythmic triggers in ACT. In contrast, control CM upregulated SERCA2a expression in a DOX-dependent manner, possibly to avoid heart failure conditions. In conclusion, we developed the first human patient-specific stem cell model of DOX-induced cardiac dysfunction from patients with B-cell lymphoma. Our results suggest that DOX-induced stress resulted in arrhythmogenic events associated with contractile dysfunction and finally in heart failure after persistent stress activation in ACT patients.},

In situ transcriptomic methods generate spatially resolved RNA profiles in intact tissues. However, there is a lack of a unified computational framework for integrative analysis of in situ transcriptomic data. Here, we introduce an unsupervised and annotation-free framework, termed ClusterMap, which incorporates the physical location and gene identity of RNAs, formulates the task as a point pattern analysis problem, and identifies biologically meaningful structures by density peak clustering (DPC). Specifically, ClusterMap precisely clusters RNAs into subcellular structures, cell bodies, and tissue regions in both two- and three-dimensional space, and performs consistently on diverse tissue types, including mouse brain, placenta, gut, and human cardiac organoids. We demonstrate ClusterMap to be broadly applicable to various in situ transcriptomic measurements to uncover gene expression patterns, cell niche, and tissue organization principles from images with high-dimensional transcriptomic profiles.},

  abstract = {RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are typically thought of as proteins that bind RNA through one or multiple globular RNA-binding domains (RBDs) and change the fate or function of the bound RNAs. Several hundred such RBPs have been discovered and investigated over the years. Recent proteome-wide studies have more than doubled the number of proteins implicated in RNA binding and uncovered hundreds of additional RBPs lacking conventional RBDs. In this Review, we discuss these new RBPs and the emerging understanding of their unexpected modes of RNA binding, which can be mediated by intrinsically disordered regions, protein-protein interaction interfaces and enzymatic cores, among others. We also discuss the RNA targets and molecular and cellular functions of the new RBPs, as well as the possibility that some RBPs may be regulated by RNA rather than regulate RNA.},

  abstract = {The selection of a DNA aptamer through the Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment (SELEX) method involves multiple binding steps, in which a target and a library of randomized DNA sequences are mixed for selection of a single, nucleotide-specific molecule. Usually, 10 to 20 steps are required for SELEX to be completed. Throughout this process it is necessary to discriminate between true DNA aptamers and unspecified DNAbinding sequences. Thus, a novel machine learning-based approach was developed to support and simplify the early steps of the SELEX process, to help discriminate binding between DNA aptamers from those unspecified targets of DNA-binding sequences. An Artificial Intelligence (AI) approach to identify aptamers were implemented based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML). NLP method (CountVectorizer) was used to extract information from the nucleotide sequences. Four ML algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Gaussian Na\"ive Bayes, Support Vector Machines) were trained using data from the NLP method along with sequence information. The best performing model was Support Vector Machines because it had the best ability to discriminate between positive and negative classes. In our model, an Accuracy (A) of 0.995, the fraction of samples that the model correctly classified, and an Area Under the Receiving Operating Curve (AUROC) of 0.998, the degree by which a model is capable of distinguishing between classes, were observed. The developed AI approach is useful to identify potential DNA aptamers to reduce the amount of rounds in a SELEX selection. This new approach could be applied in the design of DNA libraries and result in a more efficient and faster process for DNA aptamers to be chosen during SELEX.},

Nucleic acid aptamers are selected in vitro from libraries containing random sequences of up to a few hundred nucleotides. Selection is based on the ability to bind ligand molecules with high affinity and specificity. Three-dimensional structures have been determined at high resolution for a number of aptamers in complex with their cognate ligands. Structures of aptamer complexes reveal the key molecular interactions conferring specificity to the aptamer-ligand association, including the precise stacking of flat moieties, specific hydrogen bonding, and molecular shape complementarity. These basic principles of discriminatory molecular interactions in aptamer complexes parallel recognition events central to many cellular processes involving nucleic acids.},

The coordination between leader cell and follower cell affects the rate of collective cell migration. However, there are still very few papers on the impacts of the stimulus signal released by the leader on the follower. Tracking cell movement using 3D time-lapse microscopy images provides an unprecedented opportunity to systematically study and analyze collective cell migration. RESULTS: Recently, deep reinforcement learning algorithms have become very popular. In our paper, we also use this method to train the number of cells and control signals. By experimenting with single-follower cell and multi-follower cells, it is concluded that the number of stimulation signals is proportional to the rate of collective movement of the cells. Such research provides a more diverse approach and approach to studying biological problems. CONCLUSION: Traditional research methods are always based on real-life scenarios, but as the number of cells grows exponentially, the research process is too time consuming. Agent-based modeling is a robust framework that approximates cells to isotropic, elastic, and sticky objects. In this paper, an agent-based modeling framework is used to establish a simulation platform for simulating collective cell migration.

Here, we evaluate 21 human genome-wide interaction networks for their ability to recover 446 disease gene sets identified through literature curation, gene expression profiling, or genome-wide association studies. While all networks have some ability to recover disease genes, we observe a wide range of performance with STRING, ConsensusPathDB, and GIANT networks having the best performance overall. A general tendency is that performance scales with network size, suggesting that new interaction discovery currently outweighs the detrimental effects of false positives. Correcting for size, we find that the DIP network provides the highest efficiency (value per interaction). Based on these results, we create a parsimonious composite network with both high efficiency and performance. This work provides a benchmark for selection of molecular networks in human disease research. We evaluate 21 human genome-wide interaction networks for their ability to recover 446 disease gene sets.

  abstract = {Gene networks are rapidly growing in size and number, raising the question of which networks are most appropriate for particular applications. Here, we evaluate 21 human genome-wide interaction networks for their ability to recover 446 disease gene sets identified through literature curation, gene expression profiling, or genome-wide association studies. While all networks have some ability to recover disease genes, we observe a wide range of performance with STRING, ConsensusPathDB, and GIANT networks having the best performance overall. A general tendency is that performance scales with network size, suggesting that new interaction discovery currently outweighs the detrimental effects of false positives. Correcting for size, we find that the DIP network provides the highest efficiency (value per interaction). Based on these results, we create a parsimonious composite network with both high efficiency and performance. This work provides a benchmark for selection of molecular networks in human disease research. We evaluate 21 human genome-wide interaction networks for their ability to recover 446 disease gene sets. While all networks can recover disease genes, we observe STRING, ConsensusPathDB, and GIANT networks to have the best performance overall.

  abstract = {The conclusive identity of Wnt proteins regulating liver zonation (LZ) and regeneration (LR) remains unclear despite an undisputed role of {$\beta$}-catenin. Using single-cell analysis of liver cells from various species, a conserved Wnt2 and Wnt9b expression in endothelial cells (ECs) in zone 3 shown to be the major Wnt cell source, was identified. Conditional EC-elimination of Wnt2 and Wnt9b led to perturbation of LZ with not only loss of {$\beta$}-catenin targets in zone 3, but also re-appearance of zone 1 genes in zone 3, unraveling dynamicity as revealed by single-cell spatial transcriptomics using Molecular Cartography. Defective LR observed in the knockouts phenocopied other models of defective hepatic Wnt signaling. Administration of a tetravalent antibody to activate Wnt signaling rescued LZ and LR in the knockouts. Molecular Cartography on the livers of the agonist-treated animal revealed changes in LZ. Administration of the agonist also promoted LR in acetaminophen overdose acute liver failure (ALF) fulfilling an unmet clinical need. Overall, we report an unequivocal role of EC-Wnt2 and Wnt9b in LZ and LR and show the role of Wnt activators as regenerative therapy for ALF.},

Here, we present a comprehensive study to elucidate how heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoparticle (hnRNP) proteins, among the most abundant RNA binding proteins, coordinate to regulate alternative pre-mRNA splicing (AS) in human cells. Using splicing-sensitive microarrays, crosslinking and immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (CLIP-seq), and cDNA sequencing, we find that more than half of all AS events are regulated by multiple hnRNP proteins and that some combinations of hnRNP proteins exhibit significant synergy, whereas others act antagonistically. Our analyses reveal position-dependent RNA splicing maps, in vivo consensus binding sites, a surprising level of cross- and autoregulation among hnRNP proteins, and the coordinated regulation by hnRNP proteins of dozens of other RNA binding proteins and genes associated with cancer. Our findings define an unprecedented degree of complexity and compensatory relationships among hnRNP proteins and their splicing targets that likely confer robustness to cells.},

Here, we integrate spatially resolved transcriptomics, single-cell RNA-seq, and single-nucleus RNA-seq to characterize tumor-microenvironment interactions at the tumor boundary. Using a zebrafish model of melanoma, we identify a distinct ``interface'' cell state where the tumor contacts neighboring tissues. This interface is composed of specialized tumor and microenvironment cells that upregulate a common set of cilia genes, and cilia proteins are enriched only where the tumor contacts the microenvironment. Cilia gene expression is regulated by ETS-family transcription factors, which normally act to suppress cilia genes outside of the interface. A cilia-enriched interface is conserved in human patient samples, suggesting it is a conserved feature of human melanoma. Our results demonstrate the power of spatially resolved transcriptomics in uncovering mechanisms that allow tumors to adapt to new environments.},

Although NMD-induced loss-of-function has been shown to contribute to the genesis of particular cancers, its global functional consequence in tumours has not been characterized. Here we develop an algorithm to predict NMD and apply it on somatic mutations reported in The Cancer Genome Atlas. We identify more than 73\,K mutations that are predicted to elicit NMD (NMD-elicit). NMD-elicit mutations in tumour suppressor genes (TSGs) are associated with significant reduction in gene expression. We discover cancer-specific NMD-elicit signatures in TSGs and cancer-associated genes. Our analysis reveals a previously unrecognized dependence of hypermutated tumours on hypofunction of genes that are involved in chromatin remodelling and translation. Half of hypermutated stomach adenocarcinomas are associated with NMD-elicit mutations of the translation initiators               LARP4B               and               EIF5B               .

  abstract = {Subcellular RNA localization is a critical mechanism for the spatial control of gene expression. Its mechanism and precise functional role is not yet very well understood. Single Molecule Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization (smFISH) images allow for the detection of individual RNA molecules with subcellular accuracy. In return, smFISH requires robust methods to quantify and classify RNA spatial distribution. Here, we present PointFISH, a novel computational approach for the recognition of RNA localization patterns. PointFISH is an attention-based network for computing continuous vector representations of RNA point clouds. Trained on simulations only, it can directly process extracted coordinates from experimental smFISH images. The resulting embedding allows scalable and flexible spatial transcriptomics analysis and matches performance of hand-crafted pipelines.},

  abstract = {Infectious and inflammatory diseases have repeatedly shown strong genetic associations within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC); however, the basis for these associations remains elusive. To define host genetic effects on the outcome of a chronic viral infection, we performed genome-wide association analysis in a multiethnic cohort of HIV-1 controllers and progressors, and we analyzed the effects of individual amino acids within the classical human leukocyte antigen (HLA) proteins. We identified {$>$}300 genome-wide significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the MHC and none elsewhere. Specific amino acids in the HLA-B peptide binding groove, as well as an independent HLA-C effect, explain the SNP associations and reconcile both protective and risk HLA alleles. These results implicate the nature of the HLA-viral peptide interaction as the major factor modulating durable control of HIV infection.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Nucleic acid aptamers are generated by an in vitro molecular evolution method known as systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX). Various candidates are limited by actual sequencing data from an experiment. Here we developed RaptGen, which is a variational autoencoder for in silico aptamer generation. RaptGen exploits a profile hidden Markov model decoder to represent motif sequences effectively. We showed that RaptGen embedded simulation sequence data into low-dimensional latent space on the basis of motif information. We also performed sequence embedding using two independent SELEX datasets. RaptGen successfully generated aptamers from the latent space even though they were not included in high-throughput sequencing. RaptGen could also generate a truncated aptamer with a short learning model. We demonstrated that RaptGen could be applied to activity-guided aptamer generation according to Bayesian optimization. We concluded that a generative method by RaptGen and latent representation are useful for aptamer discovery.},

  abstract = {Abstract                        Single cell and spatial technologies that profile gene expression across a whole tissue are revolutionizing the resolution of molecular states in clinical tissue samples. Commercially available methods that characterize either single cell or spatial gene expression are currently limited by low sample throughput and/or gene plexy, lack of on-instrument analysis, and the destruction of histological features and epitopes during the workflow. Here, we analyzed large, serial formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) human breast cancer sections using a novel FFPE-compatible single cell gene expression workflow (Chromium Fixed RNA Profiling; scFFPE-seq), spatial transcriptomics (Visium CytAssist), and automated microscopy-based in situ technology using a 313-plex gene panel (Xenium In Situ). Whole transcriptome profiling of the FFPE tissue using scFFPE-seq and Visium facilitated the identification of 17 different cell types. Xenium allowed us to spatially resolve these cell types and their gene expression profiles with single cell resolution. Due to the non-destructive nature of the Xenium workflow, we were able to perform H\&E staining and immunofluorescence on the same section post-processing which allowed us to spatially register protein, histological, and RNA data together into a single image. Integration of data from Chromium scFFPE-seq, Visium, and Xenium across serial sections allowed us to do extensive benchmarking of sensitivity and specificity between the technologies. Furthermore, data integration inspired the interrogation of three molecularly distinct tumor subtypes (low-grade and high-grade ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), and invasive carcinoma). We used Xenium to characterize cellular composition and differentially expressed genes within these subtypes. This analysis allowed us to draw biological insights about DCIS progression to infiltrating carcinoma, as the myoepithelial layer degrades and tumor cells invade the surrounding stroma. Xenium also allowed us to further predict the hormone receptor status of tumor subtypes, including a small 0.1 mm             2             DCIS region that was triple positive for             ESR1             (estrogen receptor),             PGR             (progesterone receptor), and             ERBB2             (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, a.k.a. HER2) RNA. In order to derive whole transcriptome information from these cells, we used Xenium data to interpolate the cell composition of Visium spots, and used Visium whole transcriptome information to discover new biomarkers of breast tumor subtypes. We demonstrate that scFFPE-seq, Visium, and Xenium independently provide information about molecular signatures relevant to understanding cancer heterogeneity. However, it is the integration of these technologies that leads to even deeper insights, ushering in discoveries that will progress oncology research and the development of diagnostics and therapeutics.},

Here, we applied a bioinformatic tool, MiSplice, for the large-scale discovery of splice-site-creating mutations (SCMs) across 8,656 TCGA tumors. We report 1,964 originally mis-annotated mutations having clear evidence of creating alternative splice junctions. TP53 and GATA3 have 26 and 18 SCMs, respectively, and ATRX has 5 from lower-grade gliomas. Mutations in 11 genes, including PARP1, BRCA1, and BAP1, were experimentally validated for splice-site-creating function. Notably, we found that neoantigens induced by SCMs are likely several folds more immunogenic compared to missense mutations, exemplified by the recurrent GATA3 SCM. Further, high expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 was observed in tumors with SCMs, suggesting candidates for immune blockade therapy. Our work highlights the importance of integrating DNA and RNA data for understanding the functional and the clinical implications of mutations in human diseases.},

  abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) interact with target mRNAs at specific sites to induce cleavage of the message or inhibit translation. The specific function of most mammalian miRNAs is unknown. We have predicted target sites on the 3' untranslated regions of human gene transcripts for all currently known 218 mammalian miRNAs to facilitate focused experiments. We report about 2,000 human genes with miRNA target sites conserved in mammals and about 250 human genes conserved as targets between mammals and fish. The prediction algorithm optimizes sequence complementarity using position-specific rules and relies on strict requirements of interspecies conservation. Experimental support for the validity of the method comes from known targets and from strong enrichment of predicted targets in mRNAs associated with the fragile X mental retardation protein in mammals. This is consistent with the hypothesis that miRNAs act as sequence-specific adaptors in the interaction of ribonuclear particles with translationally regulated messages. Overrepresented groups of targets include mRNAs coding for transcription factors, components of the miRNA machinery, and other proteins involved in translational regulation, as well as components of the ubiquitin machinery, representing novel feedback loops in gene regulation. Detailed information about target genes, target processes, and open-source software for target prediction (miRanda) is available at http://www.microrna.org. Our analysis suggests that miRNA genes, which are about 1\% of all human genes, regulate protein production for 10\% or more of all human genes.},

PROPER-seq first converts transcriptomes of input cells into RNA-barcoded protein libraries, in which all interacting protein pairs are captured through nucleotide barcode ligation, recorded as chimeric DNA sequences, and decoded at once by sequencing and mapping. We applied PROPER-seq to human embryonic kidney cells, T lymphocytes, and endothelial cells and identified 210,518 human PPIs (collected in the PROPER v.1.0 database). Among these, 1,365 and 2,480 PPIs are supported by published co-immunoprecipitation (coIP) and affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS) data, 17,638 PPIs are predicted by the prePPI algorithm without previous experimental validation, and 100 PPIs overlap human synthetic lethal gene pairs. In addition, four previously uncharacterized interaction partners with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) (a critical protein in DNA repair) known as XPO1, MATR3, IPO5, and LEO1 are validated in vivo. PROPER-seq presents a time-effective technology to map PPIs at the transcriptome scale, and PROPER v.1.0 provides a rich resource for studying PPIs.},

Although genome profiling studies have identified somatic single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in cancer, the extent to which these variants trigger abnormal splicing has not been systematically examined. Here we analyzed RNA sequencing and exome data from 1,812 patients with cancer and identified {$\sim$}900 somatic exonic SNVs that disrupt splicing. At least 163 SNVs, including 31 synonymous ones, were shown to cause intron retention or exon skipping in an allele-specific manner, with {$\sim$}70\% of the SNVs occurring on the last base of exons. Notably, SNVs causing intron retention were enriched in tumor suppressors, and 97\% of these SNVs generated a premature termination codon, leading to loss of function through nonsense-mediated decay or truncated protein. We also characterized the genomic features predictive of such splicing defects. Overall, this work demonstrates that intron retention is a common mechanism of tumor-suppressor inactivation.},

  abstract = {Our comprehensive analysis of alternative splicing across 32 The Cancer Genome Atlas cancer types from 8,705 patients detects alternative splicing events and tumor variants by reanalyzing RNA and whole-exome sequencing data. Tumors have up to 30\% more alternative splicing events than normal samples. Association analysis of somatic variants with alternative splicing events confirmed known trans associations with variants in SF3B1 and U2AF1 and identified additional trans-acting variants (e.g., TADA1, PPP2R1A). Many tumors have thousands of alternative splicing events not detectable in normal samples; on average, we identified z930 exon-exon junctions (``neojunctions'') in tumors not typically found in GTEx normals. From Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium data available for breast and ovarian tumor samples, we confirmed z1.7 neojunction- and z0.6 single nucleotide variant-derived peptides per tumor sample that are also predicted major histocompatibility complex-I binders (``putative neoantigens'').},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Understanding the occurrence and regulation of alternative splicing (AS) is a key task towards explaining the regulatory processes that shape the complex transcriptomes of higher eukaryotes. With the advent of high-throughput sequencing of RNA (RNA-Seq), the diversity of AS transcripts could be measured at an unprecedented depth. Although the catalog of known AS events has grown ever since, novel transcripts are commonly observed when working with less well annotated organisms, in the context of disease, or within large populations. Whereas an identification of complete transcripts is technically challenging and computationally expensive, focusing on single splicing events as a proxy for transcriptome characteristics is fruitful and sufficient for a wide range of analyses. RESULTS: We present SplAdder, an alternative splicing toolbox, that takes RNA-Seq alignments and an annotation file as input to (i) augment the annotation based on RNA-Seq evidence, (ii) identify alternative splicing events present in the augmented annotation graph, (iii) quantify and confirm these events based on the RNA-Seq data and (iv) test for significant quantitative differences between samples. Thereby, our main focus lies on performance, accuracy and usability.

  abstract = {Doxorubicin (DOX), or Adriamycin, an anthracycline antibiotic discovered serendipitously as a chemotherapeutic drug several decades ago, is still one of the most effective drugs for treating various adult and pediatric cancers (breast cancer, Hodgkin's disease, lymphoblastic leukemia). However, one of the major side effects of the continuous use of DOX is dose-dependent, long-term, and potentially lethal cardiovascular toxicity (congestive heart failure and cardiomyopathy) in cancer survivors many years after cessation of chemotherapy. In addition, predisposition to cardiotoxicity varied considerably among individuals. The long-held notion that DOX cardiotoxicity is caused by reactive oxygen species formed from the redox-cycling of DOX semiquinone lacks rigorous proof in a chronic animal model, and administration of reactive oxygen species detoxifying agents failed to reverse DOX-induced cardiac problems. In this review, I discuss the pros and cons of the reactive oxygen species pathway as a primary or secondary mechanism of DOX cardiotoxicity, the role of topoisomerases, and the potential use of mitochondrial-biogenesis-enhancing compounds in reversing DOX-induced cardiomyopathy. New approaches for well-designed clinical trials that repurpose FDA-approved drugs and naturally occurring polyphenolic compounds prophylactically to prevent or mitigate cardiovascular complications in both pediatric and adult cancer survivors are needed. Essentially, the focus should be on enhancing mitochondrial biogenesis to prevent or mitigate DOX-induced cardiotoxicity.},

  abstract = {The complex language of eukaryotic gene expression remains incompletely understood. Despite the importance suggested by many noncoding variants statistically associated with human disease, nearly all such variants have unknown mechanisms. Here, we address this challenge using an approach based on a recent machine learning advance-deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We introduce the open source package Basset to apply CNNs to learn the functional activity of DNA sequences from genomics data. We trained Basset on a compendium of accessible genomic sites mapped in 164 cell types by DNase-seq, and demonstrate greater predictive accuracy than previous methods. Basset predictions for the change in accessibility between variant alleles were far greater for Genome-wide association study (GWAS) SNPs that are likely to be causal relative to nearby SNPs in linkage disequilibrium with them. With Basset, a researcher can perform a single sequencing assay in their cell type of interest and simultaneously learn that cell's chromatin accessibility code and annotate every mutation in the genome with its influence on present accessibility and latent potential for accessibility.

  abstract = {De novo mutations (DNMs) are an important cause of genetic disorders. The accurate identification of DNMs from sequencing data is therefore fundamental to rare disease research and diagnostics. Unfortunately, identifying reliable DNMs remains a major challenge due to sequence errors, uneven coverage, and mapping artifacts. Here, we developed a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) DNM caller (DeNovoCNN), that encodes the alignment of sequence reads for a trio as 160\texttimes 164 resolution images. DeNovoCNN was trained on DNMs of 5616 whole exome sequencing (WES) trios achieving total 96.74\% recall and 96.55\% precision on the test dataset. We find that DeNovoCNN has increased recall/sensitivity and precision compared to existing DNM calling approaches (GATK, DeNovoGear, DeepTrio, Samtools) based on the Genome in a Bottle reference dataset and independent WES and WGS trios. Validations of DNMs based on Sanger and PacBio HiFi sequencing confirm that DeNovoCNN outperforms existing methods. Most importantly, our results suggest that DeNovoCNN is likely robust against different exome sequencing and analyses approaches, thereby allowing the application on other datasets. DeNovoCNN is freely available as a Docker container and can be run on existing alignment (BAM/CRAM) and variant calling (VCF) files from WES and WGS without a need for variant recalling.},

  abstract = {A key public health need is to identify individuals at high risk for a given disease to enable enhanced screening or preventive therapies. Because most common diseases have a genetic component, one important approach is to stratify individuals based on inherited DNA variation1. Proposed clinical applications have largely focused on finding carriers of rare monogenic mutations at several-fold increased risk. Although most disease risk is polygenic in nature2-5, it has not yet been possible to use polygenic predictors to identify individuals at risk comparable to monogenic mutations. Here, we develop and validate genome-wide polygenic scores for five common diseases. The approach identifies 8.0, 6.1, 3.5, 3.2, and 1.5\% of the population at greater than threefold increased risk for coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, and breast cancer, respectively. For coronary artery disease, this prevalence is 20-fold higher than the carrier frequency of rare monogenic mutations conferring comparable risk6. We propose that it is time to contemplate the inclusion of polygenic risk prediction in clinical care, and discuss relevant issues.},

  abstract = {In our cells, a limited number of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) are responsible for all aspects of RNA metabolism across the entire transcriptome. To accomplish this, RBPs form regulatory units that act on specific target regulons. However, the landscape of RBP combinatorial interactions remains poorly explored. Here, we performed a systematic annotation of RBP combinatorial interactions via multimodal data integration. We built a large-scale map of RBP protein neighborhoods by generating in vivo proximity-dependent biotinylation datasets of 50 human RBPs. In parallel, we used CRISPR interference with single-cell readout to capture transcriptomic changes upon RBP knockdowns. By combining these physical and functional interaction readouts, along with the atlas of RBP mRNA targets from eCLIP assays, we generated an integrated map of functional RBP interactions. We then used this map to match RBPs to their context-specific functions and validated the predicted functions biochemically for four RBPs. This study highlights the previously underappreciated scale of the inter-RBP interactions, be it genetic or physical, and is a first step towards a more comprehensive understanding of post-transcriptional regulatory processes and their underlying molecular grammar.},

We developed REVEALER, a computational method that identifies combinations of mutually exclusive genomic alterations correlated with functional phenotypes, such as the activation or gene dependency of oncogenic pathways or sensitivity to a drug treatment. We used REVEALER to uncover complementary genomic alterations associated with the transcriptional activation of {$\beta$}-catenin and NRF2, MEK-inhibitor sensitivity, and KRAS dependency. REVEALER successfully identified both known and new associations, demonstrating the power of combining functional profiles with extensive characterization of genomic alterations in cancer genomes.},

  abstract = {The systematic sequencing of the cancer genome has provided a powerful framework for identifying genetic alterations in cancer. However, a deeper understanding of the functional consequences of these alterations is necessary to guide appropriate therapeutic strategies. Here, we describe Onco-GPS (OncoGenic Positioning System), a data-driven analysis framework, and associated experimental and computational methodology, to organize individual tumor samples with shared oncogenic alterations onto a reference map defined by their underlying cellular states. This is achieved by taking three modular steps; i) experimental generation of a relevant oncogenic activation signature, ii) decomposition of this signature into its constituent components or coordinates, and iii) defining cellular states and generating a two-dimensional visual paradigm, called an Onco-GPS map, to represent simultaneously: components, individual samples and cellular states. We applied the OncoGPS methodology to cancers with altered RAS/MAPK signaling and identified 9 distinct components that reflect transcriptional activities downstream of active KRAS, and defined several divergent functional states associated with distinct patterns of transcriptional component activation, genomic hallmarks and response to genetic and pharmacological perturbations of single and combination agents. These results show that the Onco-GPS is an effective approach to explore the complex landscape of oncogenic cellular states across cancers, and a powerful framework to summarize knowledge, establish relationships, and generate more effective disease models for research or as part of individualized precision medicine paradigms.},

However, due to the large variability in gene expression, identifying cell types based on the transcriptome remains challenging. We present Single\-Cell Consensus Clustering (SC3), a tool for unsupervised clustering of scRNA\-seq data. SC3 achieves high accuracy and robustness by consistently integrating different clustering solutions through a consensus approach. Tests on twelve published datasets show that SC3 outperforms five existing methods while remaining scalable, as shown by the analysis of a large dataset containing 44,808 cells. Moreover, an interactive graphical implementation makes SC3 accessible to a wide audience of users, and SC3 aids biological interpretation by identifying marker genes, differentially expressed genes and outlier cells. We illustrate the capabilities of SC3 by characterising newly obtained transcriptomes from subclones of neoplastic cells collected from patients.},

Here we present cytoself, a deep-learning approach for fully self-supervised protein localization profiling and clustering. Cytoself leverages a self-supervised training scheme that does not require preexisting knowledge, categories or annotations. Training cytoself on images of 1,311 endogenously labeled proteins from the OpenCell database reveals a highly resolved protein localization atlas that recapitulates major scales of cellular organization, from coarse classes, such as nuclear and cytoplasmic, to the subtle localization signatures of individual protein complexes. We quantitatively validate cytoself's ability to cluster proteins into organelles and protein complexes, showing that cytoself outperforms previous self-supervised approaches. Moreover, to better understand the inner workings of our model, we dissect the emergent features from which our clustering is derived, interpret them in the context of the fluorescence images, and analyze the performance contributions of each component of our approach.},

  abstract = {Large collections of annotated single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) experiments are being generated across different organs, conditions and organisms on different platforms. The diversity, volume and complexity of this aggregated data requires new analysis techniques to extract actionable knowledge. Fundamental to most analysis are key abilities such as: identification of similar cells across different experiments and transferring annotations from an annotated dataset to an unannotated one. There have been many strategies explored in achieving these goals, and they focuses primarily on aligning and re-clustering datasets of interest. In this work, we are interested in exploring the applicability of deep metric learning methods as a form of distance function to capture similarity between cells and facilitate the transfer of cell type annotation for similar cells across different experiments. Toward this aim, we developed MapCell, a few-shot training approach using Siamese Neural Networks (SNNs) to learn a generalizable distance metric that can differentiate between single cell types. Requiring only a small training set, we demonstrated that SNN derived distance metric can perform accurate transfer of annotation across different scRNA-seq platforms, batches, species and also aid in flagging novel cell types.},

Although MAPK pathway inhibitors show clinical benefit in BRAF(V600)-mutant melanoma, it remains incompletely understood why 10\% to 20\% of patients fail to respond. Here, we show that RAF inhibitor-sensitive and inhibitor-resistant BRAF(V600)-mutant melanomas display distinct transcriptional profiles. Whereas most drug-sensitive cell lines and patient biopsies showed high expression and activity of the melanocytic lineage transcription factor MITF, intrinsically resistant cell lines and biopsies displayed low MITF expression but higher levels of NF-{$\kappa$}B signaling and the receptor tyrosine kinase AXL. In vitro, these MITF-low/NF-{$\kappa$}B-high melanomas were resistant to inhibition of RAF and MEK, singly or in combination, and ERK. Moreover, in cell lines, NF-{$\kappa$}B activation antagonized MITF expression and induced both resistance marker genes and drug resistance. Thus, distinct cell states characterized by MITF or NF-{$\kappa$}B activity may influence intrinsic resistance to MAPK pathway inhibitors in BRAF(V600)-mutant melanoma.\textbackslash textbackslashn\textbackslash textbackslashnSIGNIFICANCE: Although most BRAF(V600)-mutant melanomas are sensitive to RAF and/or MEK inhibitors, a subset fails to respond to such treatment. This study characterizes a transcriptional cell state distinction linked to MITF and NF-{$\kappa$}B that may modulate intrinsic sensitivity of melanomas to MAPK pathway inhibitors.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: High-content screening (HCS) technologies have enabled large scale imaging experiments for studying cell biology and for drug screening. These systems produce hundreds of thousands of microscopy images per day and their utility depends on automated image analysis. Recently, deep learning approaches that learn feature representations directly from pixel intensity values have dominated object recognition challenges. These tasks typically have a single centered object per image and existing models are not directly applicable to microscopy datasets. Here we develop an approach that combines deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with multiple instance learning (MIL) in order to classify and segment microscopy images using only whole image level annotations. RESULTS: We introduce a new neural network architecture that uses MIL to simultaneously classify and segment microscopy images with populations of cells. We base our approach on the similarity between the aggregation function used in MIL and pooling layers used in CNNs. To facilitate aggregating across large numbers of instances in CNN feature maps we present the Noisy-AND pooling function, a new MIL operator that is robust to outliers. Combining CNNs with MIL enables training CNNs using whole microscopy images with image level labels. We show that training end-to-end MIL CNNs outperforms several previous methods on both mammalian and yeast datasets without requiring any segmentation steps. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Torch7 implementation available upon request. CONTACT: oren.kraus@mail.utoronto.ca.},

Stimulus-induced alterations in RBP function contribute to global changes in gene expression, but identifying which RBPs are responsible for the observed changes remains an unmet need. Here, we present Transite, a computational approach that systematically infers RBPs influencing gene expression through changes in RNA stability and degradation. As a proof of principle, we apply Transite to RNA expression data from human patients with non-small-cell lung cancer whose tumors were sampled at diagnosis or after recurrence following treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy. Transite implicates known RBP regulators of the DNA damage response and identifies hnRNPC as a new modulator of chemotherapeutic resistance, which we subsequently validated experimentally. Transite serves as a framework for the identification of RBPs that drive cell-state transitions and adds additional value to the vast collection of publicly available gene expression datasets.},

We address these challenges by developing DrugCell, an interpretable deep learning model of human cancer cells trained on the responses of 1,235 tumor cell lines to 684 drugs. Tumor genotypes induce states in cellular subsystems that are integrated with drug structure to predict response to therapy and, simultaneously, learn biological mechanisms underlying the drug response. DrugCell predictions are accurate in cell lines and also stratify clinical outcomes. Analysis of DrugCell mechanisms leads directly to the design of synergistic drug combinations, which we validate systematically by combinatorial CRISPR, drug-drug screening in vitro, and patient-derived xenografts. DrugCell provides a blueprint for constructing interpretable models for predictive medicine.},

Recent high-throughput analyses have revealed that neurites contain hundreds to thousands of mRNAs, but an analysis comparing the transcriptomes derived from these studies has been lacking. Here we analyze 20 datasets pertaining to neuronal mRNA localization across species and neuronal types and identify a conserved set of mRNAs that had robustly localized to neurites in a high number of the studies.

  abstract = {This unit presents the protocol for the NanoString nCounter Gene Expression Assay, a robust and highly reproducible method for detecting the expression of up to 800 genes in a single reaction with high sensitivity and linearity across a broad range of expression levels. The methodology serves to bridge the gap between genome-wide (microarrays) and targeted (real-time quantitative PCR) expression profiling. The nCounter assay is based on direct digital detection of mRNA molecules of interest using target-specific, color-coded probe pairs. It does not require the conversion of mRNA to cDNA by reverse transcription or the amplification of the resulting cDNA by PCR. Each target gene of interest is detected using a pair of reporter and capture probes carrying 35- to 50-base target-specific sequences. In addition, each reporter probe carries a unique color code at the 5' end that enables the molecular barcoding of the genes of interest, while the capture probes all carry a biotin label at the 3' end that provides a molecular handle for attachment of target genes to facilitate downstream digital detection. After solution-phase hybridization between target mRNA and reporter-capture probe pairs, excess probes are removed and the probe/target complexes are aligned and immobilized in the nCounter cartridge, which is then placed in a digital analyzer for image acquisition and data processing. Hundreds of thousands of color codes designating mRNA targets of interest are directly imaged on the surface of the cartridge. The expression level of a gene is measured by counting the number of times the color-coded barcode for that gene is detected, and the barcode counts are then tabulated.},

We performed rigorous statistical assessment of discovered co-localization patterns, found supporting evidence from databases and RNA interactions, and identified subcellular domains associated with RNA-colocalization. We identified several novel cell type-specific gene co-localizations in the brain.

During an asymmetric cell division, molecular determinants are segregated preferentially into one daughter cell to specify its fate. An important goal is to identify the asymmetric determinants in neural progenitor cells, which could be tumor suppressors or inducers of specific neural fates. Here, we show that the double-stranded RNA-binding protein Stau2 is distributed asymmetrically during progenitor divisions in the developing mouse cortex, preferentially segregating into the Tbr2(+) neuroblast daughter, taking with it a subset of RNAs. Knockdown of Stau2 stimulates differentiation and overexpression produces periventricular neuronal masses, demonstrating its functional importance for normal cortical development. We immunoprecipitated Stau2 to examine its cargo mRNAs, and found enrichment for known asymmetric and basal cell determinants, such as Trim32, and identified candidates, including a subset involved in primary cilium function.},

  abstract = {One major question in molecular biology is whether the spatial distribution of observed molecules is random or organized in clusters. Indeed, this analysis gives information about molecules' interactions and physical interplay with their environment. The standard tool for analyzing molecules' distribution statistically is the Ripley's K function, which tests spatial randomness through the computation of its critical quantiles. However, quantiles' computation is very cumbersome, hindering its use. Here, we present an analytical expression of these quantiles, leading to a fast and robust statistical test, and we derive the characteristic clusters' size from the maxima of the Ripley's K function. Subsequently, we analyze the spatial organization of endocytic spots at the cell membrane and we report that clathrin spots are randomly distributed while clathrin-independent spots are organized in clusters with a radius of 2 mm, which suggests distinct physical mechanisms and cellular functions for each pathway.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Huntington's disease is caused by the expansion of a CAG repeat within exon 1 of the HTT gene, which is unstable, leading to further expansion, the extent of which is brain region and peripheral tissue specific. The identification of DNA repair genes as genetic modifiers of Huntington's disease, that were known to abrogate somatic instability in Huntington's disease mouse models, demonstrated that somatic CAG expansion is central to disease pathogenesis, and that the CAG repeat threshold for pathogenesis in specific brain cells might not be known. We have previously shown that the HTT gene is incompletely spliced generating a small transcript that encodes the highly pathogenic exon 1 HTT protein. The longer the CAG repeat, the more of this toxic fragment is generated, providing a pathogenic consequence for somatic expansion. Here, we have used the R6/2 mouse model to investigate the molecular and behavioural consequences of expressing exon 1 HTT with 90 CAGs, a mutation that causes juvenile Huntington's disease, compared to R6/2 mice carrying {$\sim$}200 CAGs, a repeat expansion of a size rarely found in Huntington's disease patient's blood, but which has been detected in post-mortem brains as a consequence of somatic CAG repeat expansion. We show that nuclear aggregation occurred earlier in R6/2(CAG)90 mice and that this correlated with the onset of transcriptional dysregulation. Whereas in R6/2(CAG)200 mice, cytoplasmic aggregates accumulated rapidly and closely tracked with the progression of behavioural phenotypes and with end-stage disease. We find that aggregate species formed in the R6/2(CAG)90 brains have different properties to those in the R6/2(CAG)200 mice. Within the nucleus, they retain a diffuse punctate appearance throughout the course of the disease, can be partially solubilized by detergents and have a greater seeding potential in young mice. In contrast, aggregates from R6/2(CAG)200 brains polymerize into larger structures that appear as inclusion bodies. These data emphasize that a subcellular analysis, using multiple complementary approaches, must be undertaken in order to draw any conclusions about the relationship between HTT aggregation and the onset and progression of disease phenotypes.},

Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most prevalent and malignant primary brain tumor and contains self-renewing, tumorigenic cancer stem cells (CSCs) that contribute to tumor initiation and therapeutic resistance. As normal stem and progenitor cells participate in tissue development and repair, these developmental programs re-emerge in CSCs to support the development and progressive growth of tumors. Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms that govern CSCs has informed the development of novel targeted therapeutics for GBM and other brain cancers. CSCs are not self-autonomous units; rather, they function within an ecological system, both actively remodeling the microenvironment and receiving critical maintenance cues from their niches. To fulfill the future goal of developing novel therapies to collapse CSC dynamics, drawing parallels to other normal and pathological states that are highly interactive with their microenvironments and that use developmental signaling pathways will be beneficial.},

  abstract = {A proteogenomic method identifies potentially actionable tumor-specific antigens and shows that most of them are not coded by classic exons.           ,              Expanding the landscape of immunotherapy targets                            Most searches for druggable tumor-specific antigens (TSAs) start with an examination of peptides derived from protein-coding exons. Laumont               et al.               took a different approach and found numerous TSAs aberrantly expressed from noncoding sequences in murine cell lines and in B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia and lung cancer patient samples, but not in cells responsible for T cell selection. The authors validated the immunogenicity and efficacy of TSA vaccination for select antigens in mouse models of cancer. The finding that noncoding regions are a potentially rich source of TSAs could greatly expand the number of targetable antigens across different cancers, including those with low mutational burdens.                        ,              Tumor-specific antigens (TSAs) represent ideal targets for cancer immunotherapy, but few have been identified thus far. We therefore developed a proteogenomic approach to enable the high-throughput discovery of TSAs coded by potentially all genomic regions. In two murine cancer cell lines and seven human primary tumors, we identified a total of 40 TSAs, about 90\% of which derived from allegedly noncoding regions and would have been missed by standard exome-based approaches. Moreover, most of these TSAs derived from nonmutated yet aberrantly expressed transcripts (such as endogenous retroelements) that could be shared by multiple tumor types. Last, we demonstrated that, in mice, the strength of antitumor responses after TSA vaccination was influenced by two parameters that can be estimated in humans and could serve for TSA prioritization in clinical studies: TSA expression and the frequency of TSA-responsive T cells in the preimmune repertoire. In conclusion, the strategy reported herein could considerably facilitate the identification and prioritization of actionable human TSAs.},

Proteins are typically directed to compartments by short peptide sequences that act as targeting signals. Translocation to the proper compartment allows a protein to form the necessary interactions with its partners and take part in biological networks such as signalling and metabolic pathways. If a protein is not transported to the correct intracellular compartment either the reaction performed or information carried by the protein does not reach the proper site, causing either inactivation of central reactions or misregulation of signalling cascades, or the mislocalized active protein has harmful effects by acting in the wrong place. RESULTS: Numerous methods have been developed to predict protein subcellular localization with quite high accuracy. We applied bioinformatics methods to investigate the effects of known disease-related mutations on protein targeting and localization by analyzing over 22,000 missense mutations in more than 1,500 proteins with two complementary prediction approaches. Several hundred putative localization affecting mutations were identified and investigated statistically.

Although polyadenylated RNA was homogeneously distributed throughout the cell, actin mRNA demonstrated a nonhomogeneous distribution in 95\% of randomly selected chicken embryonic myoblasts and fibroblasts, as detected by isotopic and nonisotopic techniques. Actin mRNA concentrations were highest at cell extremities, generally in lamellipodia, where grain densities were up to 16-fold higher than in areas near the nucleus. Vimentin mRNA, unlike actin mRNA, was distributed near the nucleus. Tubulin mRNA appeared most concentrated in the peripheral cytoplasm. These results demonstrate that cytoplasmic mRNAs are localized in specific, nonrandom cellular patterns and that localized concentrations of specific proteins may result from corresponding localization of their respective mRNAs. Hence, actin mRNA distribution may result in increased concentration of actin filaments in lamellipodia of motile cells.},

  abstract = {Background: The Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway plays an important role in cerebellar development, and mutations leading to hyperactive Shh signaling have been associated with certain forms of medulloblastoma, a common form of pediatric brain cancer. While the fundamentals of this pathway are known, the molecular targets contributing to Shh-mediated proliferation and transformation are still poorly understood. Na,K-ATPase is a ubiquitous enzyme that maintains intracellular ion homeostasis and functions as a signaling scaffold and a cell adhesion molecule. Changes in Na,K-ATPase function and subunit expression have been reported in several cancers and loss of the {$\beta$}1-subunit has been associated with a poorly differentiated phenotype in carcinoma but its role in medulloblastoma progression is not known. Methods: Human medulloblastoma cell lines and primary cultures of cerebellar granule cell precursors (CGP) were used to determine whether Shh regulates Na,K-ATPase expression. Smo/Smo medulloblastoma were used to assess the Na,K-ATPase levels in vivo. Na,K-ATPase {$\beta$}1-subunit was knocked down in DAOY cells to test its role in medulloblastoma cell proliferation and tumorigenicity. Results: Na,K-ATPase {$\beta$}1-subunit levels increased with differentiation in normal CGP cells. Activation of Shh signaling resulted in reduced {$\beta$}1-subunit mRNA and protein levels and was mimicked by overexpression of Gli1and Bmi1, both members of the Shh signaling cascade; overexpression of Bmi1 reduced {$\beta$}1-subunit promoter activity. In human medulloblastoma cells, low {$\beta$}1-subunit levels were associated with increased cell proliferation and in vivo tumorigenesis. Conclusions: Na,K-ATPase {$\beta$}1-subunit is a target of the Shh signaling pathway and loss of {$\beta$}1-subunit expression may contribute to tumor development and progression not only in carcinoma but also in medulloblastoma, a tumor of neuronal origin.},

We begin by explaining why most metrics of categorical spatial association are inadequate for many common situations. Our focus is on where a single categorical data variable is measured at point locations that constitute a population of interest. We then develop our new metric, the CLQ, as a point-based association metric most similar to the cross-k-function and join count statistic. However, it differs from the former in that it is based on distance ranks rather than on raw distances and differs from the latter in that it is asymmetric. After introducing the statistical calculation and underlying rationale, a random labeling technique is described to test for significance. The new metric is applied to economic and ecological point data to demonstrate its broad utility. The method expands upon explanatory powers present in current point-based colocation statistics.},

The major challenge in this context is the combinatorial explosion of the number of set intersections if the number of sets exceeds a trivial threshold. In this paper we introduce UpSet, a novel visualization technique for the quantitative analysis of sets, their intersections, and aggregates of intersections. UpSet is focused on creating task-driven aggregates, communicating the size and properties of aggregates and intersections, and a duality between the visualization of the elements in a dataset and their set membership. UpSet visualizes set intersections in a matrix layout and introduces aggregates based on groupings and queries. The matrix layout enables the effective representation of associated data, such as the number of elements in the aggregates and intersections, as well as additional summary statistics derived from subset or element attributes. Sorting according to various measures enables a task-driven analysis of relevant intersections and aggregates. The elements represented in the sets and their associated attributes are visualized in a separate view. Queries based on containment in specific intersections, aggregates or driven by attribute filters are propagated between both views. We also introduce several advanced visual encodings and interaction methods to overcome the problems of varying scales and to address scalability. UpSet is web-based and open source. We demonstrate its general utility in multiple use cases from various domains.},

Furthermore, sequential treatment of hPSCs with glycogen synthase kinase 3 inhibitors followed by inducible expression of {$\beta$}-catenin shRNA or chemical inhibitors of Wnt signaling produced a high yield of virtually (up to 98\%) pure functional human cardiomyocytes from multiple hPSC lines. The robust ability to generate functional cardiomyocytes under defined, growth factor-free conditions solely by genetic or chemically mediated manipulation of a single developmental pathway should facilitate scalable production of cardiac cells suitable for research and regenerative applications.},

Different practical protein-centric methods for studying RNA-protein interactions has been reported, but few RNA-centric methods exist. Here, we developed CRISPR-based RNA proximity proteomics (CBRPP), a new RNA-centric method to identify proteins associated with the target RNA in native cellular context without cross-linking or RNA manipulation in vitro.

  abstract = {Quantifying DNA properties is a challenging task in the broad field of human genomics. Since the vast majority of non-coding DNA is still poorly understood in terms of function, this task is particularly important to have enormous benefit for biology research. Various DNA sequences should have a great variety of representations, and specific functions may focus on corresponding features in the front part of learning model. Currently, however, for multi-class prediction of non-coding DNA regulatory functions, most powerful predictive models do not have appropriate feature extraction and selection approaches for specific functional effects, so that it is difficult to gain a better insight into their internal correlations. Hence, we design a category attention layer and category dense layer in order to select efficient features and distinguish different DNA functions. In this study, we propose a hybrid deep neural network method, called DeepATT, for identifying 919 regulatory functions on nearly 5 million DNA sequences. Our model has four built-in neural network constructions: convolution layer captures regulatory motifs, recurrent layer captures a regulatory grammar, category attention layer selects corresponding valid features for different functions and category dense layer classifies predictive labels with selected features of regulatory functions. Importantly, we compare our novel method, DeepATT, with existing outstanding prediction tools, DeepSEA and DanQ. DeepATT performs significantly better than other existing tools for identifying DNA functions, at least increasing 1.6\% area under precision recall. Furthermore, we can mine the important correlation among different DNA functions according to the category attention module. Moreover, our novel model can greatly reduce the number of parameters by the mechanism of attention and locally connected, on the basis of ensuring accuracy.},

Through iterative self-learning, DESC gradually removes batch effects, as long as technical differences across batches are smaller than true biological variations. As a soft clustering algorithm, cluster assignment probabilities from DESC are biologically interpretable and can reveal both discrete and pseudotemporal structure of cells. Comprehensive evaluations show that DESC offers a proper balance of clustering accuracy and stability, has a small footprint on memory, does not explicitly require batch information for batch effect removal, and can utilize GPU when available. As the scale of single-cell studies continues to grow, we believe DESC will offer a valuable tool for biomedical researchers to disentangle complex cellular heterogeneity.},

  abstract = {Medulloblastoma is a highly malignant paediatric brain tumour, often inflicting devastating consequences on the developing child. Genomic studies have revealed four distinct molecular subgroups with divergent biology and clinical behaviour. An understanding of the regulatory circuitry governing the transcriptional landscapes of medulloblastoma subgroups, and how this relates to their respective developmental origins, is lacking. Here, using H3K27ac and BRD4 chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) coupled with tissue-matched DNA methylation and transcriptome data, we describe the active cis-regulatory landscape across 28 primary medulloblastoma specimens. Analysis of differentially regulated enhancers and super-enhancers reinforced inter-subgroup heterogeneity and revealed novel, clinically relevant insights into medulloblastoma biology. Computational reconstruction of core regulatory circuitry identified a master set of transcription factors, validated by ChIP-seq, that is responsible for subgroup divergence, and implicates candidate cells of origin for Group 4. Our integrated analysis of enhancer elements in a large series of primary tumour samples reveals insights into cis-regulatory architecture, unrecognized dependencies, and cellular origins.},

PTC-containing transcripts can be degraded by an mRNA surveillance pathway termed nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). However, the efficiency of NMD varies; it is inefficient when a PTC is located downstream of the last exon junction complex (EJC). We used matched exome and transcriptome data from 9,769 human tumors to systematically elucidate the rules of NMD targeting in human cells. An integrated model incorporating multiple rules beyond the canonical EJC model explains approximately three-fourths of the non-random variance in NMD efficiency across thousands of PTCs. We also show that dosage compensation may sometimes mask the effects of NMD. Applying the NMD model identifies signatures of both positive and negative selection on NMD-triggering mutations in human tumors and provides a classification for tumor-suppressor genes.},

  abstract = {Sequence-based neural networks can learn to make accurate predictions from large biological datasets, but model interpretation remains challenging. Many existing feature attribution methods are optimized for continuous rather than discrete input patterns and assess individual feature importance in isolation, making them ill-suited for interpreting non-linear interactions in molecular sequences. Building on work in computer vision and natural language processing, we developed an approach based on deep generative modeling Scrambler networks - wherein the most salient sequence positions are identified with learned input masks. Scramblers learn to generate Position-Specific Scoring Matrices (PSSMs) where unimportant nucleotides or residues are `scrambled' by raising their entropy. We apply Scramblers to interpret the effects of genetic variants, uncover non-linear interactions between cis-regulatory elements, explain binding specificity for protein-protein interactions, and identify structural determinants of de novo designed proteins. We show that interpretation based on a generative model allows for efficient attribution across large datasets and results in high-quality explanations, often outperforming state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract = {RNA hybridization-based spatial transcriptomics provides unparalleled detection sensitivity. However, inaccuracies in segmentation of image volumes into cells cause misassignment of mRNAs which is a major source of errors. Here, we develop JSTA, a computational framework for joint cell segmentation and cell type annotation that utilizes prior knowledge of cell type-specific gene expression. Simulation results show that leveraging existing cell type taxonomy increases RNA assignment accuracy by more than 45\%. Using JSTA, we were able to classify cells in the mouse hippocampus into 133 (sub)types revealing the spatial organization of CA1, CA3, and Sst neuron subtypes. Analysis of within cell subtype spatial differential gene expression of 80 candidate genes identified 63 with statistically significant spatial differential gene expression across 61 (sub)types. Overall, our work demonstrates that known cell type expression patterns can be leveraged to improve the accuracy of RNA hybridization-based spatial transcriptomics while providing highly granular cell (sub)type information. The large number of newly discovered spatial gene expression patterns substantiates the need for accurate spatial transcriptomic measurements that can provide information beyond cell (sub)type labels.},

  abstract = {The ``Roaring 20s'' of visual recognition began with the introduction of Vision Transformers (ViTs), which quickly superseded ConvNets as the state-of-the-art image classification model. A vanilla ViT, on the other hand, faces difficulties when applied to general computer vision tasks such as object detection and semantic segmentation. It is the hierarchical Transformers (e.g., Swin Transformers) that reintroduced several ConvNet priors, making Transformers practically viable as a generic vision backbone and demonstrating remarkable performance on a wide variety of vision tasks. However, the effectiveness of such hybrid approaches is still largely credited to the intrinsic superiority of Transformers, rather than the inherent inductive biases of convolutions. In this work, we reexamine the design spaces and test the limits of what a pure ConvNet can achieve. We gradually ``modernize'' a standard ResNet toward the design of a vision Transformer, and discover several key components that contribute to the performance difference along the way. The outcome of this exploration is a family of pure ConvNet models dubbed ConvNeXt. Constructed entirely from standard ConvNet modules, ConvNeXts compete favorably with Transformers in terms of accuracy and scalability, achieving 87.8\% ImageNet top-1 accuracy and outperforming Swin Transformers on COCO detection and ADE20K segmentation, while maintaining the simplicity and efficiency of standard ConvNets.},

Being unordered and irregular, many researchers focused on the feature engineering of the point cloud. Being able to learn complex hierarchical structures, deep learning has achieved great success with images from cameras. Recently, many researchers have adapted it into the applications of the point cloud. In this paper, the recent existing point cloud feature learning methods are classified as point-based and tree-based. The former directly takes the raw point cloud as the input for deep learning. The latter first employs a k-dimensional tree (Kd-tree) structure to represent the point cloud with a regular representation and then feeds these representations into deep learning models. Their advantages and disadvantages are analyzed. The applications related to point cloud feature learning, including 3D object classification, semantic segmentation, and 3D object detection, are introduced, and the datasets and evaluation metrics are also collected. Finally, the future research trend is predicted.},

To understand the spatial organization of tissue and how it relates to disease processes, imaging studies typically focus on cell-level phenotypes. However, images can capture biologically important objects that are outside of cells, such as the extracellular matrix. Here, we describe a pipeline, Pixie, that achieves robust and quantitative annotation of pixel-level features using unsupervised clustering and show its application across a variety of biological contexts and multiplexed imaging platforms. Furthermore, current cell phenotyping strategies that rely on unsupervised clustering can be labor intensive and require large amounts of manual cluster adjustments. We demonstrate how pixel clusters that lie within cells can be used to improve cell annotations. We comprehensively evaluate pre-processing steps and parameter choices to optimize clustering performance and quantify the reproducibility of our method. Importantly, Pixie is open source and easily customizable through a user-friendly interface.},

Applied to 8 samples from key stages of breast cancer progression BaSISS localised 1.42 million genotype informative transcripts across 4.9cm2 of tissue. Microscopic clonal topographies are shaped by resident tissue architectures. Distinct transcriptional, histological and immunological features distinguish coexistent genetic clones. Spatial lineage tracing temporally orders clone features associated with the emergence of aggressive clinical traits.

To address this, we developed a deep learning-based image analysis pipeline that performs segmentation, tracking, and lineage reconstruction. Our analysis focuses on time-lapse movies of Escherichia coli cells trapped in a "mother machine" microfluidic device, a scalable platform for long-term single-cell analysis that is widely used in the field. While deep learning has been applied to cell segmentation problems before, our approach is fundamentally innovative in that it also uses machine learning to perform cell tracking and lineage reconstruction. With this framework we are able to get high fidelity results (1\% error rate), without human intervention. Further, the algorithm is fast, with complete analysis of a typical frame containing \textasciitilde 150 cells taking {$<$}700msec. The framework is not constrained to a particular experimental set up and has the potential to generalize to time-lapse images of other organisms or different experimental configurations. These advances open the door to a myriad of applications including real-time tracking of gene expression and high throughput analysis of strain libraries at single-cell resolution.},

  author = {Lundberg, Scott M and Lee, Su-In},
  abstract = {Understanding why a model makes a certain prediction can be as crucial as the prediction's accuracy in many applications. However, the highest accuracy for large modern datasets is often achieved by complex models that even experts struggle to interpret, such as ensemble or deep learning models, creating a tension between accuracy and interpretability. In response, various methods have recently been proposed to help users interpret the predictions of complex models, but it is often unclear how these methods are related and when one method is preferable over another. To address this problem, we present a unified framework for interpreting predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). SHAP assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Its novel components include: (1) the identification of a new class of additive feature importance measures, and (2) theoretical results showing there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties. The new class unifies six existing methods, notable because several recent methods in the class lack the proposed desirable properties. Based on insights from this unification, we present new methods that show improved computational performance and/or better consistency with human intuition than previous approaches.},

Similar results are observed in DE analyses of real data where the use of count sums instead of single-cell counts improves specificity and the ranking of relevant genes. This suggests that summation can assist in maintaining statistical rigour in DE analyses of scRNA-seq data with plate effects.},

  abstract = {Spatial organization is an inherent property of the vertebrate genome to accommodate the roughly 2 m of DNA in the nucleus of a cell. In this nonrandom organization, topologically associating domains (TADs) emerge as a fundamental structural unit that is thought to guide regulatory elements to their cognate promoters. In this review we summarize the most recent findings about TADs and the boundary regions separating them. We discuss how the disruption of these structures by genomic rearrangements can result in gene misexpression and disease. Chromosome conformation capture techniques have enabled scientists to study the 3D organization of the genome, identifying topologically associating domains (TADs) as fundamental regulatory units of the genome.TADs and their boundary regions are critical for correct gene expression and their disruption can cause disease.TAD maps of the human genome allow better prediction of the effects of structural variations.CRISPR/Cas technology can be used to model human structural variants and understand their pathomechanisms.},

  abstract = {Cell differentiation and function are regulated across multiple layers of gene regulation, including modulation of gene expression by changes in chromatin accessibility. However, differentiation is an asynchronous process precluding a temporal understanding of regulatory events leading to cell fate commitment. Here we developed simultaneous high-throughput ATAC and RNA expression with sequencing (SHARE-seq), a highly scalable approach for measurement of chromatin accessibility and gene expression in the same single cell, applicable to different tissues. Using 34,774 joint profiles from mouse skin, we develop a computational strategy to identify cis-regulatory interactions and define domains of regulatory chromatin (DORCs) that significantly overlap with super-enhancers. During lineage commitment, chromatin accessibility at DORCs precedes gene expression, suggesting that changes in chromatin accessibility may prime cells for lineage commitment. We computationally infer chromatin potential as a quantitative measure of chromatin lineage-priming and use it to predict cell fate outcomes. SHARE-seq is an extensible platform to study regulatory circuitry across diverse cells in tissues.},

Here, we mapped active chromatin landscapes with gene expression, whole exomes, copy number profiles, and DNA methylomes across 44 patient-derived glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), 50 primary tumors, and 10 neural stem cells (NSCs) to identify essential super-enhancer (SE)\textendash associated genes and the core transcription factors that establish SEs and maintain GSC identity. GSCs segregate into two groups dominated by distinct enhancer profiles and unique developmental core transcription factor regulatory programs. Group-specific transcription factors enforce GSC identity; they exhibit higher activity in glioblastomas versus NSCs, are associated with poor clinical outcomes, and are required for glioblastoma growth in vivo. Although transcription factors are commonly considered undruggable, group-specific enhancer regulation of the MAPK/ERK pathway predicts sensitivity to MEK inhibition. These data demonstrate that transcriptional identity can be leveraged to identify novel dependencies and therapeutic approaches.},

  abstract = {Advances in spatial transcriptomics technologies produce RNA imaging data at increasingly higher throughput and scale. Current computational methods identify and measure the spatial relationships between cell-types, but do not leverage the spatial information of individual RNA molecules to reveal subcellular spatiotemporal dynamics of RNA processing. Here, we developed Bento, a computational framework for subcellular analysis of high-throughput spatial transcriptomics datasets. Bento handles single-molecule data generated by diverse spatial transcriptomics technologies and computes spatial statistics of subcellular RNA molecular distributions, compartmental expression, and cell morphology to build multidimensional feature sets for exploratory analysis. We also developed a multi-label ensemble model for generalizable classification of subcellular localization of every gene in every cell. To demonstrate Bento's utility, we applied it to analyze spatial transcriptomics datasets generated by seqFISH+ (10k genes in \textasciitilde 200 fibroblast cells) and MERFISH (130 genes quantified in \textasciitilde 1000 U2-OS cells) to understand the interplay between gene function, cellular morphology and RNA localization. To understand the role of RNA localization in RNA processing, we integrated spatial data with RNA binding protein (RBP) binding data to explore the spatiotemporal dynamics of RBP-RNA interactions at unprecedented scale (3,165 RNA species x 148 RBPs). We found RNA targets of individual RBPs to be enriched in specific subcellular compartments \textendash{} such as Splicing Factor 3a Protein Complex (SF3A3), and that preferential localization is influenced by RBP binding of genomic regions for RBPs including Staufen homolog 2 (STAU2). Bento builds on the existing ecosystem of single-cell and spatial analysis toolkits, to ensure accessibility and community-driven tool development. We provide Bento as an open-source tool for the community to further expand our understanding of subcellular biology.},

Broadly categorized in three types (i.e., sequences, images, and signals), these data are huge in amount and complex in nature. Mining such an enormous amount of data for pattern recognition is a big challenge and requires sophisticated data-intensive machine learning techniques. Artificial neural network-based learning systems are well known for their pattern recognition capabilities and lately their deep architectures - known as deep learning (DL) - have been successfully applied to solve many complex pattern recognition problems. Highlighting the role of DL in recognizing patterns in biological data, this article provides - applications of DL to biological sequences, images, and signals data; overview of open access sources of these data; description of open source DL tools applicable on these data; and comparison of these tools from qualitative and quantitative perspectives. At the end, it outlines some open research challenges in mining biological data and puts forward a number of possible future perspectives.},

We recently detected the Huntington's disease protein huntingtin (Htt) in dendritic RNA granules; however, the functional significance of this localization is not known. Here we report that Htt and the huntingtin-associated protein 1 (HAP1) are co-localized with the microtubule motor proteins, the KIF5A kinesin and dynein, during dendritic transport of {$\beta$}-actin mRNA. Live cell imaging demonstrated that {$\beta$}-actin mRNA is associated with Htt, HAP1, and dynein intermediate chain in cultured neurons. Reduction in the levels of Htt, HAP1, KIF5A, and dynein heavy chain by lentiviral-based shRNAs resulted in a reduction in the transport of {$\beta$}-actin mRNA. These findings support a role for Htt in participating in the mRNA transport machinery that also contains HAP1, KIF5A, and dynein.},

These particles represent large protein complexes that may be involved in recognizing, transporting, and anchoring localized messages. Few components of these ribonucleoparticles, however, have been identified yet. We chose the strategy to biochemically enrich native RNA-protein complexes involved in RNA transport to identify the associated RNAs and proteins. Because Staufen proteins were implicated in intracellular RNA transport, we chose mammalian Staufen proteins as markers for the purification of RNA transport particles. Here, we present evidence that Staufen proteins exist in two different complexes: (i) distinct large, ribosome- and endoplasmic reticulum-containing granules preferentially found in the membrane pellets during differential centrifugation and (ii) smaller particles in the S100 from rat brain homogenates. On gel filtration of the S100, we identified soluble 670-kDa Staufen1-containing and 440-kDa Staufen2-containing particles. They do not cofractionate with ribosomes and endoplasmic reticulum but rather coenrich with kinesin heavy chain. Furthermore, the fractions containing the Staufen1 particles show a 15-fold enrichment of mRNAs compared with control fractions. Most importantly, these fractions are highly enriched in BC1, and, to a lesser extent, in the alpha-subunit of the Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinase II, two dendritically localized RNAs. Finally, both RNAs colocalize with Staufen1-hemagglutinin in particles in dendrites of transfected hippocampal neurons. We therefore propose that these Staufen1-containing particles may represent RNA transport intermediates that are in transit to their final destination within neurons.},

  abstract = {Our expanding knowledge of the roles small regulatory RNAs play across numerous areas of biology, coupled with the promise of RNA-targeted therapies and small RNA-based medicines, create an urgent need for tools that can accurately identify and quantify small RNA:target interactions at scale. MicroRNAs (miRNA) are a major class of small RNAs in plants and animals. The experimental capture of miRNA:mRNA interactions by ligation into chimeric RNA fragments in chimeric CrossLinking and ImmunoPrecipitation (CLIP) provides a direct readout of miRNA targets by enabling profiling of miRNA targets with high-throughput sequencing. Despite the power of this approach, widespread adoption of chimeric CLIP has been slow due to both methodological technical complexity as well as limited recovery of chimeric molecules (particularly beyond the most abundant miRNAs). Here we describe chimeric eCLIP, in which we integrate a chimeric ligation step into AGO2 eCLIP to enable chimeric read recovery. We show that removal of the cumbersome polyacrylamide gel and nitrocellulose membrane transfer step common to CLIP techniques can be omitted for chimeric AGO2 eCLIP to create a simplified high throughput version of the assay that maintains high signal-to-noise. With the increased yield of recovered miRNA:mRNA interactions in no-gel chimeric eCLIP, we show that simple enrichment steps using either PCR or on-bead probe capture can be added to chimeric eCLIP in order to target and enrich libraries for chimeric reads specific to one or more miRNAs of interest in both cell lines and tissue samples, resulting in 30- to 175-fold increases in recovery of chimeric reads for miRNAs of interest. We further demonstrate that the same probe-capture approach can be used to recover miRNA interactions for a targeted gene of interest, revealing both distinct miRNA targeting as well as co-targeting by several miRNAs from the same seed family. RNA-seq analysis of gene expression following miRNA overexpression confirmed miRNA-mediated repression of chimeric eCLIP-identified targets and indicated that probe-enriched chimeric eCLIP can provide additional sensitivity to detect regulated targets among genes that either contain or lack computationally predicted miRNA target sites. Thus, we believe that chimeric eCLIP will be a useful tool for quantitative profiling of miRNA targets in varied sample types at scale, and for revealing a deeper picture for regulatory networks for specific miRNAs of biological interest.},

Their unique architecture with about four dendrites and a single axon ascending in the cerebellar cortex to bifurcate into two parallel fibers making synapses with Purkinje neurons has attracted numerous scientists. Recent advances show that they are much more than just relays of mossy fibers. They perform diverse and complex transformations in the spatiotemporal domain. This special issue highlights novel avenues in our understanding of the roles of this key neuronal population of the cerebellar cortex, ranging from developmental up to physiological and pathological points of view.}

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Counting the number of occurrences of every k-mer (substring of length k) in a long string is a central subproblem in many applications, including genome assembly, error correction of sequencing reads, fast multiple sequence alignment and repeat detection. Recently, the deep sequence coverage generated by next-generation sequencing technologies has caused the amount of sequence to be processed during a genome project to grow rapidly, and has rendered current k-mer counting tools too slow and memory intensive. At the same time, large multicore computers have become commonplace in research facilities allowing for a new parallel computational paradigm. RESULTS: We propose a new k-mer counting algorithm and associated implementation, called Jellyfish, which is fast and memory efficient. It is based on a multithreaded, lock-free hash table optimized for counting k-mers up to 31 bases in length. Due to their flexibility, suffix arrays have been the data structure of choice for solving many string problems. For the task of k-mer counting, important in many biological applications, Jellyfish offers a much faster and more memory-efficient solution. AVAILABILITY: The Jellyfish software is written in C++ and is GPL licensed. It is available for download at http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/software/jellyfish.},

The frameshift mechanism is dependent upon two RNA elements, a seven-nucleotide slippery sequence (UUUUUUA) and a downstream RNA structure. Frameshifting occurs with a frequency of approximately 5\%, and increasing or decreasing this frequency may result in a decrease in viral replication. Here, we report the results of a high-throughput screen designed to find small molecules that bind to the HIV-1 frameshift site RNA. Out of 34,500 compounds screened, 202 were identified as positive hits. We show that one of these compounds, doxorubicin, binds the HIV-1 RNA with low micromolar affinity (K(d) = 2.8 microM). This binding was confirmed and localized to the RNA using NMR. Further analysis revealed that this compound increased the RNA stability by approximately 5 degrees C and decreased translational frameshifting by 28\% (+/-14\%), as measured in vitro.},

  abstract = {The UNAFold software package is an integrated collection of programs that simulate folding, hybridization, and melting pathways for one or two single-stranded nucleic acid sequences. The name is derived from ``Unified Nucleic Acid Folding.'' Folding (secondary structure) prediction for single-stranded RNA or DNA combines free energy minimization, partition function calculations and stochastic sampling. For melting simulations, the package computes entire melting profiles, not just melting temperatures. UV absorbance at 260 nm, heat capacity change (Cp), and mole fractions of different molecular species are computed as a function of temperature. The package installs and runs on all Unix and Linux platforms that we have looked at, including Mac OS X. Images of secondary structures, hybridizations, and dot plots may be computed using common formats. Similarly, a variety of melting profile plots is created when appropriate. These latter plots include experimental results if they are provided. The package is ``command line'' driven. Underlying compiled programs may be used individually, or in special combinations through the use of a variety of Perl scripts. Users are encouraged to create their own scripts to supplement what comes with the package. This evolving software is available for download at http://www.bioinfo.rpi.edu/applications/hybrid/download.php.}

Augmenting few real observations with generated in silico samples could lead to more robust analysis results and a higher reproducibility rate. Here, we propose the use of conditional single-cell generative adversarial neural networks (cscGAN) for the realistic generation of single-cell RNA-seq data. cscGAN learns non-linear gene\textendash gene dependencies from complex, multiple cell type samples and uses this information to generate realistic cells of defined types. Augmenting sparse cell populations with cscGAN generated cells improves downstream analyses such as the detection of marker genes, the robustness and reliability of classifiers, the assessment of novel analysis algorithms, and might reduce the number of animal experiments and costs in consequence. cscGAN outperforms existing methods for single-cell RNA-seq data generation in quality and hold great promise for the realistic generation and augmentation of other biomedical data types.},

We demonstrate that at least some exitrons originate from ancestral coding exons. Based on our findings, we propose a ``splicing memory'' hypothesis whereby upon intron loss imprints of former exon borders defined by vestigial splicing regulatory elements could drive the evolution of exitron splicing.

However, the major ethical and scientific challenge surrounding clinical implementation of PRS is that those available today are several times more accurate in individuals of European ancestry than other ancestries. This disparity is an inescapable consequence of Eurocentric biases in genome-wide association studies, thus highlighting that-unlike clinical biomarkers and prescription drugs, which may individually work better in some populations but do not ubiquitously perform far better in European populations-clinical uses of PRS today would systematically afford greater improvement for European-descent populations. Early diversifying efforts show promise in leveling this vast imbalance, even when non-European sample sizes are considerably smaller than the largest studies to date. To realize the full and equitable potential of PRS, greater diversity must be prioritized in genetic studies, and summary statistics must be publically disseminated to ensure that health disparities are not increased for those individuals already most underserved.},

  abstract = {Alternative splicing is a key mechanism determinant for gene expression in metazoan. During alternative splicing, non-coding sequences are removed to generate different mature messenger RNAs due to a combination of sequence elements and cellular factors that contribute to splicing regulation. A different combination of splicing sites, exonic or intronic sequences, mutually exclusive exons or retained introns could be selected during alternative splicing to generate different mature mRNAs that could in turn produce distinct protein products. Alternative splicing is the main source of protein diversity responsible for 90\% of human gene expression, and it has recently become a hallmark for cancer with a full potential as a prognostic and therapeutic tool. Currently, more than 15,000 alternative splicing events have been associated to different aspects of cancer biology, including cell proliferation and invasion, apoptosis resistance and susceptibility to different chemotherapeutic drugs. Here, we present well established and newly discovered splicing events that occur in different cancer-related genes, their modification by several approaches and the current status of key tools developed to target alternative splicing with diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.},

  abstract = {The central aims of many host or environmental microbiome studies are to elucidate factors associated with microbial community compositions and to relate microbial features to outcomes. However, these aims are often complicated by difficulties stemming from high-dimensionality, non-normality, sparsity, and the compositional nature of microbiome data sets. A key tool in microbiome analysis is beta diversity, defined by the distances between microbial samples. Many different distance metrics have been proposed, all with varying discriminatory power on data with differing characteristics. Here, we propose a compositional beta diversity metric rooted in a centered log-ratio transformation and matrix completion called robust Aitchison PCA. We demonstrate the benefits of compositional transformations upstream of beta diversity calculations through simulations. Additionally, we demonstrate improved effect size, classification accuracy, and robustness to sequencing depth over the current methods on several decreased sample subsets of real microbiome data sets. Finally, we highlight the ability of this new beta diversity metric to retain the feature loadings linked to sample ordinations revealing salient intercommunity niche feature importance. IMPORTANCE By accounting for the sparse compositional nature of microbiome data sets, robust Aitchison PCA can yield high discriminatory power and salient feature ranking between microbial niches. The software to perform this analysis is available under an open-source license and can be obtained at https://github.com/biocore/DEICODE; additionally, a QIIME 2 plugin is provided to perform this analysis at https://library.qiime2.org/plugins/deicode/.},

Benchmarking results indicate DeepMAPS performs better than existing tools in cell clustering and biological network construction. It also showcases competitive capability in deriving cell-type-specific biological networks in lung tumor leukocyte CITE-seq data and matched diffuse small lymphocytic lymphoma scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data. In addition, we deploy a DeepMAPS webserver equipped with multiple functionalities and visualizations to improve the usability and reproducibility of scMulti-omics data analysis.},

  abstract = {Immune evasion is a hallmark of cancer. Losing the ability to present neoantigens through human leukocyte antigen (HLA) loss may facilitate immune evasion. However, the polymorphic nature of the locus has precluded accurate HLA copy-number analysis. Here, we present loss of heterozygosity in human leukocyte antigen (LOHHLA), a computational tool to determine HLA allele-specific copy number from sequencing data. Using LOHHLA, we find that HLA LOH occurs in 40\% of non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) and is associated with a high subclonal neoantigen burden, APOBEC-mediated mutagenesis, upregulation of cytolytic activity, and PD-L1 positivity. The focal nature of HLA LOH alterations, their subclonal frequencies, enrichment in metastatic sites, and occurrence as parallel events suggests that HLA LOH is an immune escape mechanism that is subject to strong microenvironmental selection pressures later in tumor evolution. Characterizing HLA LOH with LOHHLA refines neoantigen prediction and may have implications for our understanding of resistance mechanisms and immunotherapeutic approaches targeting neoantigens.

In embryonic cardiomyocytes, both the complete and the cardiac myocyte-specific null mutant of Ca(V){$\beta$}2 resulted in reduction of L-type calcium currents by up to 75\%, compromising heart function and causing defective remodeling of intra- and extra-embryonic blood vessels followed by embryonic death. Here we conditionally excised the Ca(V){$\beta$}2 gene (cacnb2) specifically in cardiac myocytes of adult mice (KO). Upon gene deletion, Ca(V){$\beta$}2 protein expression declined by {$>$}96\% in isolated cardiac myocytes and by {$>$}74\% in protein fractions from heart. These latter protein fractions include Ca(V){$\beta$}2 proteins expressed in cardiac fibroblasts. Surprisingly, mice did not show any obvious impairment, although cacnb2 excision was not compensated by expression of other Ca(V){$\beta$} proteins or changes of Ca(V)1.2 protein levels. Calcium currents were still dihydropyridine-sensitive, but current density at 0 mV was reduced by {$<$}29\%. The voltage for half-maximal activation was slightly shifted to more depolarized potentials in KO cardiomyocytes when compared with control cells, but the difference was not significant. In summary, Ca(V){$\beta$}2 appears to be a much stronger modulator of L-type calcium currents in embryonic than in adult cardiomyocytes. Although essential for embryonic survival, Ca(V){$\beta$}2 down-regulation in cardiomyocytes is well tolerated by the adult mice.},

  abstract = {Somatic mutations have been extensively characterized in breast cancer, but the effects of these genetic alterations on the proteomic landscape remain poorly understood. Here we describe quantitative mass-spectrometry-based proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses of 105 genomically annotated breast cancers, of which 77 provided high-quality data. Integrated analyses provided insights into the somatic cancer genome including the consequences of chromosomal loss, such as the 5q deletion characteristic of basal-like breast cancer. Interrogation of the 5q trans-effects against the Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures, connected loss of CETN3 and SKP1 to elevated expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and SKP1 loss also to increased SRC tyrosine kinase. Global proteomic data confirmed a stromal-enriched group of proteins in addition to basal and luminal clusters, and pathway analysis of the phosphoproteome identified a G-protein-coupled receptor cluster that was not readily identified at the mRNA level. In addition to ERBB2, other amplicon-associated highly phosphorylated kinases were identified, including CDK12, PAK1, PTK2, RIPK2 and TLK2. We demonstrate that proteogenomic analysis of breast cancer elucidates the functional consequences of somatic mutations, narrows candidate nominations for driver genes within large deletions and amplified regions, and identifies therapeutic targets.},

  abstract = {Somatic mutations have been extensively characterized in breast cancer, but the effects of these genetic alterations on the proteomic landscape remain poorly understood. Here we describe quantitative mass-spectrometry-based proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses of 105 genomically annotated breast cancers, of which 77 provided high-quality data. Integrated analyses provided insights into the somatic cancer genome including the consequences of chromosomal loss, such as the 5q deletion characteristic of basal-like breast cancer. Interrogation of the 5q trans-effects against the Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures, connected loss of CETN3 and SKP1 to elevated expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and SKP1 loss also to increased SRC tyrosine kinase. Global proteomic data confirmed a stromal-enriched group of proteins in addition to basal and luminal clusters, and pathway analysis of the phosphoproteome identified a G-protein-coupled receptor cluster that was not readily identified at the mRNA level. In addition to ERBB2, other amplicon-associated highly phosphorylated kinases were identified, including CDK12, PAK1, PTK2, RIPK2 and TLK2. We demonstrate that proteogenomic analysis of breast cancer elucidates the functional consequences of somatic mutations, narrows candidate nominations for driver genes within large deletions and amplified regions, and identifies therapeutic targets.}

  abstract = {The actin-related protein 2/3 (Arp2/3) complex is a crucial actin polymerization nucleator and is localized to the leading protrusions of migrating cells. However, how the multiprotein complex is targeted to the protrusions remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that mRNAs for the seven subunits of the Arp2/3 complex are localized to the protrusions in fibroblasts, supporting a hypothesis that the Arp2/3 complex is targeted to its site of function by mRNA localization. Depletion of serum from culture medium inhibits Arp2/3-complex mRNA localization to the protrusion, whereas serum stimulation leads to significant mRNA localization within 30 minutes. The effect of serum suggests that Arp2/3-complex mRNA localization is a cellular response to extracellular stimuli. The localization of the Arp2/3 complex mRNAs is dependent on both actin filaments and microtubules, because disruption of either cytoskeletal system (with cytochalasin D and colchicine, respectively) inhibited the localization of all seven subunit mRNAs. In addition, myosin inhibitors significantly inhibit Arp2 mRNA localization in chicken embryo fibroblasts, suggesting a myosin motor dependent mechanism for Arp2/3-complex mRNA localization.},

  abstract = {Deciphering the genomic regulatory code of enhancers is a key challenge in biology because this code underlies cellular identity. A better understanding of how enhancers work will improve the interpretation of noncoding genome variation and empower the generation of cell type\textendash specific drivers for gene therapy. Here, we explore the combination of deep learning and cross-species chromatin accessibility profiling to build explainable enhancer models. We apply this strategy to decipher the enhancer code in melanoma, a relevant case study owing to the presence of distinct melanoma cell states. We trained and validated a deep learning model, called DeepMEL, using chromatin accessibility data of 26 melanoma samples across six different species. We show the accuracy of DeepMEL predictions on the CAGI5 challenge, where it significantly outperforms existing models on the melanoma enhancer of               IRF4               . Next, we exploit DeepMEL to analyze enhancer architectures and identify accurate transcription factor binding sites for the core regulatory complexes in the two different melanoma states, with distinct roles for each transcription factor, in terms of nucleosome displacement or enhancer activation. Finally, DeepMEL identifies orthologous enhancers across distantly related species, where sequence alignment fails, and the model highlights specific nucleotide substitutions that underlie enhancer turnover. DeepMEL can be used from the Kipoi database to predict and optimize candidate enhancers and to prioritize enhancer mutations. In addition, our computational strategy can be applied to other cancer or normal cell types.},

The method can also be used to represent the consensus over multiple runs of a clustering algorithm with random restart (such as K-means, model-based Bayesian clustering, SOM, etc.), so as to account for its sensitivity to the initial conditions.

Asymmetric RNA localization is known in several cell types but is poorly understood in gut epithelial cells. Moor               et al.               found that transcripts in intestinal enterocytes tend to distribute to the cells' apical or basal cell sides (see the Perspective by G\'asp\'ar and Ephrussi). mRNA localization does not generally overlap protein localization; instead, ribosomes are apically biased, which allows more efficient translation. On refeeding of fasted mice, gut cell mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins exhibit a basal-to-apical shift in localization and a boost in translation.

External gradients of morphogens, directional blood flow, as well as the secretion and absorption of materials by cells generate distinct microenvironments at different tissue coordinates. Such spatial heterogeneity enables optimized function through division of labor among cells. Unraveling the design principles that govern this spatial division of labor requires techniques to quantify the entire transcriptomes of cells while accounting for their spatial coordinates.

  abstract = {Exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) can be a powerful approach to understanding single-cell genomics datasets, but it is not yet part of standard data analysis workflows. In particular, geospatial analyses, which have been developed and refined for decades, have yet to be fully adapted and applied to spatial single-cell analysis. We introduce the Voyager platform, which systematically brings the geospatial ESDA tradition to (spatial) -omics, with local, bivariate, and multivariate spatial methods not yet commonly applied to spatial -omics, united by a uniform user interface. Using Voyager, we showcase biological insights that can be derived with its methods, such as biologically relevant negative spatial autocorrelation. Underlying Voyager is the SpatialFeatureExperiment data structure, which combines Simple Feature with SingleCellExperiment and AnnData to represent and operate on geometries bundled with gene expression data. Voyager has comprehensive tutorials demonstrating ESDA built on GitHub Actions to ensure reproducibility and scalability, using data from popular commercial technologies. Voyager is implemented in both R/Bioconductor and Python/PyPI, and features compatibility tests to ensure that both implementations return consistent results.},

Recent approaches to highly multiplexed imaging generate high-plex data from sequential rounds of lower-plex imaging. These multiplexed imaging methods promise to yield precise molecular single-cell data and information on cellular neighborhoods and tissue architecture. However, attaining mosaic images with single-cell accuracy requires robust image stitching and image registration capabilities that are not met by existing methods.We describe the development and testing of ASHLAR, a Python tool for coordinated stitching and registration of 103 or more individual multiplexed images to generate accurate whole-slide mosaics. ASHLAR reads image formats from most commercial microscopes and slide scanners, and we show that it performs better than existing open-source and commercial software. ASHLAR outputs standard OME-TIFF images that are ready for analysis by other open-source tools and recently developed image analysis pipelines.ASHLAR is written in Python and is available under the MIT license at https://github.com/labsyspharm/ashlar.

  abstract = {napari 0.4.18 We're happy to announce the release of napari 0.4.18! napari is a fast, interactive, multi-dimensional image viewer for Python. It's designed for browsing, annotating, and analyzing large multi-dimensional images. It's built on top of Qt (for the GUI), vispy (for performant GPU-based rendering), and the scientific Python stack (numpy, scipy). This is primarily a bug-fix release, addressing many issues from 0.4.17 (see "Bug Fixes", below). However, it also contains some performance improvements and several exciting new features (see "Highlights"), so read on below! For more information, examples, and documentation, please visit our website: https://napari.org Highlights Drawing polygons in the Shapes layer can now be done much faster with the new lasso tool (napari/napari/\#5555) Surface layers now support textures and vertex colors, allowing a whole new type of dataset to be visualised in napari. Have a look at surface\_multi\_texture.py and surface\_texture\_and\_colors.py in the examples directory for some pretty demos! (napari/napari/\#5642) Previously, navigating an image required switching out of whatever drawing mode you might have been using and going back to pan/zoom mode. Now you can use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out in any mode. (napari/napari/\#5701) Painting labels is now much, much faster (achieving 60fps even on an 8k x 8k image) (napari/napari/\#5723 and napari/napari/\#5732) Vectors layers can now be displayed with two different styles of arrowheads, instead of just plain lines. This removes a longstanding limitation of the vectors layer!

  abstract = {Clinically relevant immunological biomarkers that discriminate between diverse hypofunctional states of tumor-associated CD8               +               T cells remain disputed. Using multiomics analysis of CD8               +               T cell features across multiple patient cohorts and tumor types, we identified tumor niche\textendash dependent exhausted and other types of hypofunctional CD8               +               T cell states. CD8               +               T cells in ``supportive'' niches, like melanoma or lung cancer, exhibited features of tumor reactivity\textendash driven exhaustion (CD8               +               T               EX               ). These included a proficient effector memory phenotype, an expanded T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire linked to effector exhaustion signaling, and a cancer-relevant T cell\textendash activating immunopeptidome composed of largely shared cancer antigens or neoantigens. In contrast, ``nonsupportive'' niches, like glioblastoma, were enriched for features of hypofunctionality distinct from canonical exhaustion. This included immature or insufficiently activated T cell states, high wound healing signatures, nonexpanded TCR repertoires linked to anti-inflammatory signaling, high T cell\textendash recognizable self-epitopes, and an antiproliferative state linked to stress or prodeath responses. In situ spatial mapping of glioblastoma highlighted the prevalence of dysfunctional CD4               +               :CD8               +               T cell interactions, whereas ex vivo single-cell secretome mapping of glioblastoma CD8               +               T cells confirmed negligible effector functionality and a promyeloid, wound healing\textendash like chemokine profile. Within immuno-oncology clinical trials, anti\textendash programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) immunotherapy facilitated glioblastoma's tolerogenic disparities, whereas dendritic cell (DC) vaccines partly corrected them. Accordingly, recipients of a DC vaccine for glioblastoma had high effector memory CD8               +               T cells and evidence of antigen-specific immunity. Collectively, we provide an atlas for assessing different CD8               +               T~cell hypofunctional states in immunogenic versus nonimmunogenic cancers.                        ,                             Tumor reactivity-driven exhausted CD8               +               T cells and tolerized CD8               +               T cells associate with contrasting immunotherapy responses in human cancers.                        ,              Interrogating T cells                            Responses to cancer immunotherapy regimens depend on a number of factors, including the T cells and the cancer cells themselves. Here, Naulaerts               et~al               . compared CD8               +               T cell phenotypes across multiple cancer types to identify features that associated with those tumors. CD8               +               T cells in immunogenic cancers such as melanoma and lung adenocarcinoma tended to have traditional exhaustion signatures. In contrast, CD8               +               T cells in glioblastoma were enriched for a distinct hypofunctional state. The authors investigated clinical trial data to further highlight these differences and also showed that a dendritic cell vaccine may correct the hypofunctional CD8               +               T cell state observed in glioblastoma. Together, these results provide insight into CD8               +               T cell phenotypes in the context of human cancer. \textemdash CM},

  abstract = {Single-cell RNA-sequencing has emerged as a powerful technique for characterizing cellular heterogeneity, but it is currently impractical on large sample cohorts and cannot be applied to fixed specimens collected as part of routine clinical care. We previously developed an approach for digital cytometry, called CIBERSORT, that enables estimation of cell type abundances from bulk tissue transcriptomes. We now introduce CIBERSORTx, a machine learning method that extends this framework to infer cell-type-specific gene expression profiles without physical cell isolation. By minimizing platform-specific variation, CIBERSORTx also allows the use of single-cell RNA-sequencing data for large-scale tissue dissection. We evaluated the utility of CIBERSORTx in multiple tumor types, including melanoma, where single-cell reference profiles were used to dissect bulk clinical specimens, revealing cell-type-specific phenotypic states linked to distinct driver mutations and response to immune checkpoint blockade. We anticipate that digital cytometry will augment single-cell profiling efforts, enabling cost-effective, high-throughput tissue characterization without the need for antibodies, disaggregation or viable cells.},

We subjected the exomes of ten unrelated probands to massively parallel sequencing. After filtering against existing SNP databases, there was no compelling candidate gene containing previously unknown variants in all affected individuals. Less stringent filtering criteria allowed for the presence of modest genetic heterogeneity or missing data but also identified multiple candidate genes. However, genotypic and phenotypic stratification highlighted MLL2, which encodes a Trithorax-group histone methyltransferase: seven probands had newly identified nonsense or frameshift mutations in this gene. Follow-up Sanger sequencing detected MLL2 mutations in two of the three remaining individuals with Kabuki syndrome (cases) and in 26 of 43 additional cases. In families where parental DNA was available, the mutation was confirmed to be de novo (n = 12) or transmitted (n = 2) in concordance with phenotype. Our results strongly suggest that mutations in MLL2 are a major cause of Kabuki syndrome.},

  abstract = {Multiplexed RNA sequencing in individual cells is transforming basic and clinical life sciences1\textendash 4. Often, however, tissues must first be dissociated, and crucial information about spatial relationships and communication between cells is thus lost. Existing approaches to reconstruct tissues assign spatial positions to each cell, independently of other cells, by using spatial patterns of expression of marker genes5,6\textemdash which often do not exist. Here we reconstruct spatial positions with little or no prior knowledge, by searching for spatial arrangements of sequenced cells in which nearby cells have transcriptional profiles that are often (but not always) more similar than cells that are farther apart. We formulate this task as a generalized optimal-transport problem for probabilistic embedding and derive an efficient iterative algorithm to solve it. We reconstruct the spatial expression of genes in mammalian liver and intestinal epithelium, fly and zebrafish embryos, sections from the mammalian cerebellum and whole kidney, and use the reconstructed tissues to identify genes that are spatially informative. Thus, we identify an organization principle for the spatial expression of genes in animal tissues, which can be exploited to infer meaningful probabilities of spatial position for individual cells. Our framework (`novoSpaRc') can incorporate prior spatial information and is compatible with any single-cell technology. Additional principles that underlie the cartography of gene expression can be tested using our approach.}

It is therefore not surprising that mitochondrial dysfunction has emerged as a key factor in a myriad of diseases, including neurodegenerative and metabolic disorders.

  abstract = {Massively parallel genetic screens have been used to map sequence-to-function relationships for a variety of genetic elements. However, because these approaches only interrogate short sequences, it remains challenging to perform high throughput (HT) assays on constructs containing combinations of sequence elements arranged across multi-kb length scales. Overcoming this barrier could accelerate synthetic biology; by screening diverse gene circuit designs, ``composition-to-function'' mappings could be created that reveal genetic part composability rules and enable rapid identification of behavior-optimized variants. Here, we introduce CLASSIC, a generalizable genetic screening platform that combines long- and short-read next-generation sequencing (NGS) modalities to quantitatively assess pooled libraries of DNA constructs of arbitrary length. We show that CLASSIC can measure expression profiles of {$>$}105 drug-inducible gene circuit designs (ranging from 6-9 kb) in a single experiment in human cells. Using statistical inference and machine learning (ML) approaches, we demonstrate that data obtained with CLASSIC enables predictive modeling of an entire circuit design landscape, offering critical insight into underlying design principles. Our work shows that by expanding the throughput and understanding gained with each design-build-test-learn (DBTL) cycle, CLASSIC dramatically augments the pace and scale of synthetic biology and establishes an experimental basis for data-driven design of complex genetic systems.},

Additionally, detailed analysis of retained introns can link these introns to post-transcriptional regulation or identify aberrant splicing events in human diseases. RESULTS: We present IntEREst, Intron-Exon Retention Estimator, an R package that supports rigorous analysis of non-annotated intron retention events (in addition to the ones annotated by RefSeq or similar databases), and support intra-sample in addition to inter-sample comparisons. It accepts binary sequence alignment/map (.bam) files as input and determines genome-wide estimates of intron retention or exon-exon junction levels. Moreover, it includes functions for comparing subsets of user-defined introns (e.g. U12-type vs U2-type) and its plotting functions allow visualization of the distribution of the retention levels of the introns. Statistical methods are adapted from the DESeq2, edgeR and DEXSeq R packages to extract the significantly more or less retained introns. Analyses can be performed either sequentially (on single core) or in parallel (on multiple cores). We used IntEREst to investigate the U12- and U2-type intron retention in human and plant RNAseq dataset with defects in the U12-dependent spliceosome due to mutations in the ZRSR2 component of this spliceosome. Additionally, we compared the retained introns discovered by IntEREst with that of other methods and studies. CONCLUSION: IntEREst is an R package for Intron retention and exon-exon junction levels analysis of RNA-seq data. Both the human and plant analyses show that the U12-type introns are retained at higher level compared to the U2-type introns already in the control samples, but the retention is exacerbated in patient or plant samples carrying a mutated ZRSR2 gene. Intron retention events caused by ZRSR2 mutation that we discovered using IntEREst (DESeq2 based function) show considerable overlap with the retained introns discovered by other methods (e.g. IRFinder and edgeR based function of IntEREst). Our results indicate that increase in both the number of biological replicates and the depth of sequencing library promote the discovery of retained introns, but the effect of library size gradually decreases with more than 35 million reads mapped to the introns.},

Furthermore, DNA barcodes are being leveraged for spatial transcriptomes. Although spatial resolution relies on methods used to decode DNA barcodes, achieving single-molecule decoding remains a challenge. Here, we developed an in-house sequencing system inspired by a single-molecule sequencing system, HeliScope, to spatially decode DNA barcode molecules at single-molecule resolution. We benchmarked our system with 30 types of DNA barcode molecules and obtained an average read length of \textasciitilde 20 nt with an error rate of less than 5\% per nucleotide, which was sufficient to spatially identify them. Additionally, we spatially identified DNA barcode molecules bound to antibodies at single-molecule resolution. Leveraging this, we devised a method, termed ``molecular foot printing'', showing potential for applying our system not only to spatial transcriptomics, but also to spatial proteomics.},

  abstract = {Empirically analyzing empirical evidence                            One of the central goals in any scientific endeavor is to understand causality. Experiments that seek to demonstrate a cause/effect relation most often manipulate the postulated causal factor. Aarts               et al.               describe the replication of 100 experiments reported in papers published in 2008 in three high-ranking psychology journals. Assessing whether the replication and the original experiment yielded the same result according to several criteria, they find that about one-third to one-half of the original findings were also observed in the replication study.                                         Science               , this issue               10.1126/science.aac4716                        ,              A large-scale assessment suggests that experimental reproducibility in psychology leaves a lot to be desired.           ,                             INTRODUCTION               Reproducibility is a defining feature of science, but the extent to which it characterizes current research is unknown. Scientific claims should not gain credence because of the status or authority of their originator but by the replicability of their supporting evidence. Even research of exemplary quality may have irreproducible empirical findings because of random or systematic error.                                         RATIONALE               There is concern about the rate and predictors of reproducibility, but limited evidence. Potentially problematic practices include selective reporting, selective analysis, and insufficient specification of the conditions necessary or sufficient to obtain the results. Direct replication is the attempt to recreate the conditions believed sufficient for obtaining a previously observed finding and is the means of establishing reproducibility of a finding with new data. We conducted a large-scale, collaborative effort to obtain an initial estimate of the reproducibility of psychological science.                                         RESULTS                                We conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered designs and original materials when available. There is no single standard for evaluating replication success. Here, we evaluated reproducibility using significance and                 P                 values, effect sizes, subjective assessments of replication teams, and meta-analysis of effect sizes. The mean effect size (r) of the replication effects (                 M                 r                 = 0.197, SD = 0.257) was half the magnitude of the mean effect size of the original effects (                 M                 r                 = 0.403, SD = 0.188), representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies had significant results (                 P                 {$<$} .05). Thirty-six percent of replications had significant results; 47\% of original effect sizes were in the 95\% confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39\% of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68\% with statistically significant effects. Correlational tests suggest that replication success was better predicted by the strength of original evidence than by characteristics of the original and replication teams.                                                        CONCLUSION                                No single indicator sufficiently describes replication success, and the five indicators examined here are not the only ways to evaluate reproducibility. Nonetheless, collectively these results offer a clear conclusion: A large portion of replications produced weaker evidence for the original findings despite using materials provided by the original authors, review in advance for methodological fidelity, and high statistical power to detect the original effect sizes. Moreover, correlational evidence is consistent with the conclusion that variation in the strength of initial evidence (such as original                 P                 value) was more predictive of replication success than variation in the characteristics of the teams conducting the research (such as experience and expertise). The latter factors certainly can influence replication success, but they did not appear to do so here.                              Reproducibility is not well understood because the incentives for individual scientists prioritize novelty over replication. Innovation is the engine of discovery and is vital for a productive, effective scientific enterprise. However, innovative ideas become old news fast. Journal reviewers and editors may dismiss a new test of a published idea as unoriginal. The claim that ``we already know this'' belies the uncertainty of scientific evidence. Innovation points out paths that are possible; replication points out paths that are likely; progress relies on both. Replication can increase certainty when findings are reproduced and promote innovation when they are not. This project provides accumulating evidence for many findings in psychological research and suggests that there is still more work to do to verify whether we know what we think we know.                                                   Original study effect size versus replication effect size (correlation coefficients).                   Diagonal line represents replication effect size equal to original effect size. Dotted line represents replication effect size of 0. Points below the dotted line were effects in the opposite direction of the original. Density plots are separated by significant (blue) and nonsignificant (red) effects.                                                                         ,              Reproducibility is a defining feature of science, but the extent to which it characterizes current research is unknown. We conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered designs and original materials when available. Replication effects were half the magnitude of original effects, representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies had statistically significant results. Thirty-six percent of replications had statistically significant results; 47\% of original effect sizes were in the 95\% confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39\% of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68\% with statistically significant effects.

  abstract = {Dimension-reduction methods, such as t-SNE or UMAP, are widely used when exploring high-dimensional data describing many entities, for example, RNA-seq data for many single cells. However, dimension reduction is commonly prone to introducing artifacts, and we hence need means to see where a dimension-reduced embedding is a faithful representation of the local neighborhood and where it is not. We present Sleepwalk, a simple but powerful tool that allows the user to interactively explore an embedding, using color to depict original or any other distances from all points to the cell under the mouse cursor. We show how this approach not only highlights distortions but also reveals otherwise hidden characteristics of the data, and how Sleepwalk's comparative modes help integrate multisample data and understand differences between embedding and preprocessing methods. Sleepwalk is a versatile and intuitive tool that unlocks the full power of dimension reduction and will be of value not only in single-cell RNA-seq but also in any other area with matrix-shaped big data.},

For linear RNAs, RBPsuite predicts the RBP binding scores with them using our updated iDeepS. For circular RNAs (circRNAs), RBPsuite predicts the RBP binding scores with them using our developed CRIP. RBPsuite first breaks the input RNA sequence into segments of 101 nucleotides and scores the interaction between the segments and the RBPs. RBPsuite further detects the verified motifs on the binding segments gives the binding scores distribution along the full-length sequence. Conclusions: RBPsuite is an easy-to-use online webserver for predicting RBP binding sites and freely available at http://www.csbio.sjtu.edu.cn/bioinf/RBPsuite/.},

  abstract = {Humans detect and interpret faces and facial expressions in a scene with little or no effort. Still, development of an automated system that accomplishes this task is rather difficult. There are several related problems: detection of an image segment as a face, extraction of the facial expression information, and classification of the expression (e.g., in emotion categories). A system that performs these operations accurately and in real time would form a big step in achieving a human-like interaction between man and machine. The paper surveys the past work in solving these problems. The capability of the human visual system with respect to these problems is discussed, too. It is meant to serve as an ultimate goal and a guide for determining recommendations for development of an automatic facial expression analyzer.},

Here, we investigated the relationship between disease-associated proteins and their subcellular localizations, based on the assumption that protein pairs associated with phenotypically similar diseases are more likely to be connected via subcellular localization. The spatial constraints from subcellular localization significantly strengthened the disease associations of the proteins connected by subcellular localizations. In particular, certain disease types were more prevalent in specific subcellular localizations. We analyzed the enrichment of disease phenotypes within subcellular localizations, and found that there exists a significant correlation between disease classes and subcellular localizations. Furthermore, we found that two diseases displayed high comorbidity when disease-associated proteins were connected via subcellular localization. We newly explained 7584 disease pairs by using the context of protein subcellular localization, which had not been identified using shared genes or PPIs only. Our result establishes a direct correlation between protein subcellular localization and disease association, and helps to understand the mechanism of human disease progression.},

Although current high-resolution imaging techniques provide ample information, the analysis methods for localization have either been qualitative or employed quantification in nonrandomly selected regions of interest. Here, we describe an analytical method for objective quantification of mRNA localization using a combination of two characteristics of its molecular distribution, polarization and dispersion. The validity of the method is demonstrated using single-molecule FISH images of budding yeast and fibroblasts. Live-cell analysis of endogenous {$\beta$}-actin mRNA in mouse fibroblasts reveals that mRNA polarization has a half-life of 16 min and is cross-correlated with directed cell migration. This novel approach provides insights into the dynamic regulation of mRNA localization and its physiological roles.},

Here, we train an 11-layer neural network on data from mapping thousands of yeast proteins, achieving per cell localization classification accuracy of 91\%, and per protein accuracy of 99\% on held-out images. We confirm that low-level network features correspond to basic image characteristics, while deeper layers separate localization classes. Using this network as a feature calculator, we train standard classifiers that assign proteins to previously unseen compartments after observing only a small number of training examples. Our results are the most accurate subcellular localization classifications to date, and demonstrate the usefulness of deep learning for high-throughput microscopy.},

These indicators can detect different macrophage cell sub-populations originating from different progenitors as well as their activation state, and how these changes are related to specific differences in morphology and molecular content.

We present here a noninvasive optical approach that can retrieve quantitative biomarkers of both morphological and molecular phenotypes of individual cells, based on a combination of quantitative phase imaging and Raman spectroscopy measurements. We then develop generalized statistical tools to assess the influence of both controlled (cell sub-populations, immune stimulation) and uncontrolled (culturing conditions, animal variations, etc.) experimental parameters on the label-free biomarkers. These indicators can detect different macrophage cell sub-populations originating from different progenitors as well as their activation state, and how these changes are related to specific differences in morphology and molecular content. The molecular indicators also display further sensitivity that allow identification of other experimental conditions, such as differences between cells originating from different animals, allowing the detection of outlier behaviour from given cell sub-populations.},

While each single-modality assay reveals distinctive features about the sequenced cells, true multi-omics assays are still in early stage of development. This notion signifies the importance of computationally integrating single-cell omics data that are conducted on various samples across various modalities. In addition, the advent of multiplexed molecular imaging assays has given rise to a need for computational methods for integrative analysis of single-cell imaging and omics data. Here, we present GLUER (inte             G             rative ana             L             ysis of m             U             lti-omics at single-c             E             ll             R             esolution), a flexible tool for integration of single-cell multi-omics data and imaging data. Using multiple true multi-omics data sets as the ground truth, we demonstrate that GLUER achieved significant improvement over existing methods in terms of the accuracy of matching cells across different data modalities resulting in ameliorating downstream analyses such as clustering and trajectory inference. We further demonstrate the broad utility of GLUER for integrating single-cell transcriptomics data with imaging-based spatial proteomics and transcriptomics data. Finally, we extend GLUER to leverage true cell-pair labels when available in true multi-omics data, and show that this approach improves co-embedding and clustering results. With the rapid accumulation of single-cell multi-omics and imaging data, integrated data holds the promise of furthering our understanding of the role of heterogeneity in development and disease.},

We observed that many aptamers have a conserved hairpin, yet the sequence of the hairpin can be highly variable. Taking such a secondary structure information into consideration, a new algorithm combining conserved primary sequences and secondary structures is developed, that combines three scores based on sequence abundance, stability, and structure, respectively. This algorithm was used in the prediction of aptamers from caffeine and theophylline selections. In the late rounds of the selection, when the library was converged, the predicted sequences matched well with the most abundant sequences. When the library was far from convergence and the sequences were deemed impossible for traditional analysis methods, the algorithm still predicted aptamer sequences that were experimentally verified by isothermal titration calorimetry. This algorithm paves a new way to look for patterns in aptamer selection libraries and mimics the sequence evolution process. It will help shorten the aptamer selection time and promote the biosensor application of aptamers.},

New protocols, based on             in situ             sequencing or multiplexed RNA fluorescent             in situ             hybridization register positions of single molecules in fixed tissue slices. Analysis of such data at the level of individual cells, however, requires accurate identification of cell boundaries. While many existing methods are able to approximate cell center positions using nuclei stains, current protocols do not report robust signal on the cell membranes, making accurate cell segmentation a key barrier for downstream analysis and interpretation of the data. To address this challenge, we developed a tool for Bayesian Segmentation of Spatial Transcriptomics Data (             Baysor             ), which optimizes segmentation considering the likelihood of transcriptional composition, size and shape of the cell. The Bayesian approach can take into account nuclear or cytoplasm staining, however can also perform segmentation based on the detected transcripts alone. We show that Baysor segmentation can in some cases nearly double the number of the identified cells, while reducing contamination. Importantly, we demonstrate that Baysor performs well on data acquired using five different spatially-resolved protocols, making it a useful general tool for analysis of high-resolution spatial data.},

  abstract = {Spatial Transcriptomics is an emerging technology that adds spatial dimensionality and tissue morphology to the genome-wide transcriptional profile of cells in an undissociated tissue. Integrating these three types of data creates a vast potential for deciphering novel biology of cell types in their native morphological context. Here we developed innovative integrative analysis approaches to utilise all three data types to first find cell types, then reconstruct cell type evolution within a tissue, and search for tissue regions with high cell-to-cell interactions. First, for normalisation of gene expression, we compute a distance measure using morphological similarity and neighbourhood smoothing. The normalised data is then used to find clusters that represent transcriptional profiles of specific cell types and cellular phenotypes. Clusters are further sub-clustered if cells are spatially separated. Analysing anatomical regions in three mouse brain sections and 12 human brain datasets, we found the spatial clustering method more accurate and sensitive than other methods. Second, we introduce a method to calculate transcriptional states by pseudo-space-time (PST) distance. PST distance is a function of physical distance (spatial distance) and gene expression distance (pseudotime distance) to estimate the pairwise similarity between transcriptional profiles among cells within a tissue. We reconstruct spatial transition gradients within and between cell types that are connected locally within a cluster, or globally between clusters, by a directed minimum spanning tree optimisation approach for PST distance. The PST algorithm could model spatial transition from non-invasive to invasive cells within a breast cancer dataset. Third, we utilise spatial information and gene expression profiles to identify locations in the tissue where there is both high ligand-receptor interaction activity and diverse cell type co-localisation. These tissue locations are predicted to be hotspots where cell-cell interactions are more likely to occur. We detected tissue regions and ligand-receptor pairs significantly enriched compared to background distribution across a breast cancer tissue. Together, these three algorithms, implemented in a comprehensive Python software stLearn, allow for the elucidation of biological processes within healthy and diseased tissues.},

  abstract = {The spatiotemporal regulation of gene expression is key to many biological processes. Recent imaging approaches opened exciting perspectives for understanding the intricate mechanisms regulating RNA metabolism, from synthesis to decay. Imaging techniques allow their observation at high spatial and temporal resolution, while keeping cellular morphology and micro-environment intact. Here, we focus on approaches for imaging single RNA molecules in cells, tissues, and embryos. In fixed cells, the rapid development of smFISH multiplexing opens the way to large-scale single-molecule studies, while in live cells, gene expression can be observed in real time in its native context. We highlight the strengths and limitations of these methods, as well as future challenges. We present how they advanced our understanding of gene expression heterogeneity and bursting, as well as the spatiotemporal aspects of splicing, translation, and RNA decay. These insights yield a dynamic and stochastic view of gene expression in single cells.},

Furthermore, Spateo reconstructs 3D models of whole embryos, and performs 3D morphometric analyses. Lastly, Spateo introduces the concept of ``morphometric vector field'' of cell migrations, and integrates spatial differential geometry to unveil regulatory programs underlying various organogenesis patterns of Drosophila. Thus, Spateo enables the study of the ecology of organs at a molecular level in 3D space, beyond isolated single cells.},

  abstract = {The anthracyclines are a group of antibiotics that are among the most potent chemotherapeutic agents. They are highly effective against a broad spectrum of malignancies, including lymphoma, gastric cancer, small cell lung cancer, sarcoma, and breast cancer. Unfortunately, these agents also exhibit a well-recognized cumulative-dose related cardiotoxic profile that limits the extent to which they can be used safely. In clinical practice, most clinicians limit the cumulative dose of doxorubicin (the most widely used agent in this group) to 400-450 mg/m2, but considerable cardiac damage is now known to occur at cumulative dosages considerably below this level. Regimens using newer combinations of agents, the most widely studied of which is the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab, are known to augment the cardiotoxicity of anthracyclines. The application of nanotechnology to medicine involves the use of devices that will interact with the body at the molecular level. These methods can lead to target and tissue specific clinical application, often with minimal or reduced side effects. Liposomal preparations incorporate such technology, thereby altering some important characteristics of the parent compound and facilitating concentration at the tumor site. In the case of liposomal doxorubicin, cardiotoxicity is reduced significantly. This review summarizes the important information on the liposomal preparation of anthracyclines.},

  abstract = {High-throughput transcriptomic profiling approaches have revealed that alternative splicing (AS) of precursor mRNAs, a fundamental process by which cells expand their transcriptomic diversity, is particularly widespread in the nervous system. AS events detected in the brain are more highly conserved than those detected in other tissues, suggesting that they more often provide conserved functions. Our understanding of the mechanisms and functions of neural AS events has significantly advanced with the coupling of various computational and experimental approaches. These studies indicate that dynamic regulation of AS in the nervous system is critical for modulating protein-protein interactions, transcription networks, and multiple aspects of neuronal development. Furthermore, several underappreciated classes of AS with the aforementioned roles in neuronal cells have emerged from unbiased, global approaches. Collectively, these findings emphasize the importance of characterizing neural AS in order to gain new insight into pathways that may be altered in neurological diseases and disorders.},

Constructing predictive statistical models typically requires extraction of curated predictor variables from normalized EHR data, a labor-intensive process that discards the vast majority of information in each patient's record.

In the sequential format we propose, this volume of EHR data unrolled into a total of 46,864,534,945 data points, including clinical notes. Deep learning models achieved high accuracy for tasks such as predicting in-hospital mortality (AUROC across sites 0.93-0.94), 30-day unplanned readmission (AUROC 0.75-0.76), prolonged length of stay (AUROC 0.85-0.86), and all of a patient's final discharge diagnoses (frequency-weighted AUROC 0.90). These models outperformed state-of-the-art traditional predictive models in all cases. We also present a case-study of a neural-network attribution system, which illustrates how clinicians can gain some transparency into the predictions.

Convenient access to a collection requires an index, which is manually created at great labor and expense. Since current handwriting recognizers do not perform well on historical documents, a technique called word spotting has been developed: clusters with occurrences of the same word in a collection are established using image matching. By annotating ``interesting'' clusters, an index can be built automatically. We present an algorithm for matching handwritten words in noisy historical documents. The segmented word images are preprocessed to create sets of 1-dimensional features, which are then compared using dynamic time warping. We present experimental results on two different data sets from the George Washington collection. Our experiments show that this algorithm performs better and is faster than competing matching techniques.},

  abstract = {Doxorubicin (Dox) is a secondary metabolite of the mutated strain of Streptomyces peucetius var. Caesius and belongs to the anthracyclines family. The anti-cancer activity of Dox is mainly exerted through the DNA inter\- calation and inhibiting topoisomerase II enzyme in fast-proliferating tumors. However, Dox causes cumulative and dose-dependent cardiotoxicity, which results in increased risks of mortality among cancer patients and thus limiting its wide clinical applications. There are several mechanisms has been proposed for doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity and oxidative stress, free radical generation and apoptosis are most widely reported. Apart from this, other mechanisms are also involved in Dox-induced cardiotoxicity such as impaired mitochondrial function, a perturbation in iron regulatory protein, disruption of Ca2+ homeostasis, autophagy, the release of nitric oxide and inflammatory mediators and altered gene and protein expression that involved apoptosis. Dox also causes downregulation of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) enzyme activity which leads to a reduction in the DNA methylation process. This hypomethylation causes dysregulation in the mitochondrial genes like peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator (PGC)-1-alpha (PGC-1{$\alpha$}), nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF-1) and mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) unit in the heart. Apart from DNA methylation, Dox treatment also alters the micro RNAs levels and histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity. Therefore, in the current review, we have provided a detailed update on the current understanding of the pathological mechanisms behind the wellknown Dox-induced cardiotoxicity. Further, we have provided some of the most plausible pharmacological strategies which have been tested against Dox-induced cardiotoxicity.},

  abstract = {Summary                        Spatiotemporal regulation of the cellular transcriptome is crucial for proper protein expression and cellular function             1             . However, the intricate subcellular dynamics of RNA synthesis, decay, export, and translocation remain obscured due to the limitations of existing transcriptomics methods             2\textendash 8             . Here, we report a spatiotemporally resolved RNA mapping method (TEMPOmap) to uncover subcellular RNA profiles across time and space at the single-cell level in heterogeneous cell populations. TEMPOmap integrates pulse-chase metabolic labeling of the transcriptome with highly multiplexed three-dimensional (3D)             in situ             sequencing to simultaneously profile the age and location of individual RNA molecules. Using TEMPOmap, we constructed the subcellular RNA kinetic landscape of 991 genes in human HeLa cells from upstream transcription to downstream subcellular translocation. Clustering analysis of critical RNA kinetic parameters across single cells revealed kinetic gene clusters whose expression patterns were shaped by multi-step kinetic sculpting. Importantly, these kinetic gene clusters are functionally segregated, suggesting that subcellular RNA kinetics are differentially regulated to serve molecular and cellular functions in cell-cycle dependent manner. Together, these single-cell spatiotemporally resolved transcriptomics measurements provide us the gateway to uncover new gene regulation principles and understand how kinetic strategies enable precise RNA expression in time and space.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mitochondrial replacement (MR) therapy is a new assisted reproductive technology that allows women with mitochondrial disorders to give birth to healthy children by combining their nuclei with mitochondria from unaffected egg donors. Evolutionary biologists have raised concerns about the safety of MR therapy based on the extent to which nuclear and mitochondrial genomes are observed to co-evolve within natural populations, i.e. the nuclear-mitochondrial mismatch hypothesis. In support of this hypothesis, a number of previous studies on model organisms have provided evidence for incompatibility between nuclear and mitochondrial genomes from divergent populations of the same species. RESULTS: We tested the nuclear-mitochondrial mismatch hypothesis for humans by observing the extent of naturally occurring nuclear-mitochondrial mismatch seen for 2,504 individuals across 26 populations, from 5 continental populations groups, characterized as part of the 1000 Genomes Project (1KGP). We also performed a replication analysis on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotypes for 1,043 individuals from 58 populations, characterized as part of the Human Genome Diversity Project (HGDP). Nuclear DNA (nDNA) and mtDNA sequences from the 1KGP were directly compared within and between populations, and the population distributions of mtDNA haplotypes derived from both sequence (1KGP) and genotype (HGDP) data were evaluated. Levels of nDNA and mtDNA pairwise sequence divergence are highly correlated, consistent with their co-evolution among human populations. However, there are numerous cases of co-occurrence of nuclear and mitochondrial genomes from divergent populations within individual humans. Furthermore, pairs of individuals with closely related nuclear genomes can have highly divergent mtDNA haplotypes. Supposedly mismatched nuclear-mitochondrial genome combinations are found not only within individuals from populations known to be admixed, where they may be expected, but also from populations with low overall levels of observed admixture. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that mitochondrial and nuclear genomes from divergent human populations can co-exist within healthy individuals, indicating that mismatched nDNA-mtDNA combinations are not deleterious or subject to purifying selection. Accordingly, human nuclear-mitochondrial mismatches are not likely to jeopardize the safety of MR therapy.},

A single main splice isoform reflects the biological reality for most protein coding genes and APPRIS principal isoforms are the best predictors of these main proteins isoforms. Here, we present the updates to the database, new developments that include the addition of three new species (chimpanzee, Drosophila melangaster and Caenorhabditis elegans), the expansion of APPRIS to cover the RefSeq gene set and the UniProtKB proteome for six species and refinements in the core methods that make up the annotation pipeline. In addition APPRIS now provides a measure of reliability for individual principal isoforms and updates with each release of the GENCODE/Ensembl and RefSeq reference sets.

Its applications range from astronomy to bioinformatics, bibliometrics, and pattern recognition. We propose an approach based on the idea that cluster centers are characterized by a higher density than their neighbors and by a relatively large distance from points with higher densities. This idea forms the basis of a clustering procedure in which the number of clusters arises intuitively, outliers are automatically spotted and excluded from the analysis, and clusters are recognized regardless of their shape and of the dimensionality of the space in which they are embedded. We demonstrate the power of the algorithm on several test cases.},

We developed Slide-seq, a method for transferring RNA from tissue sections onto a surface covered in DNA-barcoded beads with known positions, allowing the locations of the RNA to be inferred by sequencing. Using Slide-seq, we localized cell types identified by single-cell RNA sequencing datasets within the cerebellum and hippocampus, characterized spatial gene expression patterns in the Purkinje layer of mouse cerebellum, and defined the temporal evolution of cell type\textendash specific responses in a mouse model of traumatic brain injury.

DOX binds to the groove of poly(rA){$\cdot$}2poly(rU), while it intercalates into poly(rA){$\cdot$}poly(rU) and forms external complex with poly(rA) and poly(rU). Fluorescence lifetime measurements have shown that all the RNA/DOX complexes are non-fluorescent. The affinity with the duplex is some 15 times greater than with the triplex; this behaviour favours the isothermal denaturation of the triplex/DOX complex according to reaction poly(rA){$\cdot$}2poly(rU)/DOX + DOX {$\rightleftharpoons$} poly(rA){$\cdot$}poly(rU)/DOX + poly(rU)/DOX, that is, the reaction shifts to right upon increasing the DOX content. ITC measurements have revealed that, under the same conditions, the affinity of DOX with the RNA duplex is higher than with ctDNA, a striking outcome as long as the binding of DOX to DNA seems to be the origin of its biological action.},

The phylogeny reconstructs the entire mutational history of the human mtDNA, thus defining the mtDNA haplogroups and differentiating ancient from recent mtDNA mutations. Pathogenic mutations are classified by both genotype and phenotype, and the NUMT sequences permits detection of spurious inclusion of pseudogene variants during mutation analysis.

We present three studies of how they are using notebooks to document and share exploratory data analyses. In the first, we analyzed over 1 million computational notebooks on GitHub, finding that one in four had no explanatory text but consisted entirely of visualizations or code. In a second study, we examined over 200 academic computational notebooks, finding that although the vast majority described methods, only a minority discussed reasoning or results. In a third study, we interviewed 15 academic data analysts, finding that most considered computational notebooks personal, exploratory, and messy. Importantly, they typically used other media to share analyses. These studies demonstrate a tension between exploration and explanation in constructing and sharing computational notebooks. We conclude with opportunities to encourage explanation in computational media without hindering exploration.},

Neurons make use of this localized protein synthesis during initial growth, regeneration and functional maintenance of their axons. Although the first evidence for protein synthesis in axons dates back to 1960s, improved methodologies, including the ability to isolate axons to purity, highly sensitive RNA detection methods and imaging approaches, have shed new light on the complexity of the transcriptome of the axon and how it is regulated. Moreover, these efforts are now uncovering new roles for locally synthesized proteins in neurological diseases and injury responses. In this Cell Science at a Glance article and the accompanying poster, we provide an overview of how axonal mRNA transport and translation are regulated, and discuss their emerging links to neurological disorders and neural repair.},

Using simulated images, we design and validate a set of features describing different RNA localization patterns including polarized distribution, accumulation in cell extensions or foci, at the cell membrane or nuclear envelope. These features are largely invariant to RNA levels, work in multiple cell lines, and can measure localization strength in perturbation experiments. Most importantly, they allow classification by supervised and unsupervised learning at unprecedented accuracy. We successfully validate our approach on representative experimental data. This analysis reveals a surprisingly high degree of localization heterogeneity at the single cell level, indicating a dynamic and plastic nature of RNA localization.},

  abstract = {Doxorubicin (Dox) is a very potent antineoplastic agent used against several types of cancer, despite a cumulative cardiomyopathy that reduces the therapeutic index for treatment. H9c2 myoblast cells have been used as an in vitro model to study biochemical alterations induced by Dox treatment on cardiomyocyte cells. Despite the extensive work already published, few data are available regarding morphological alterations of H9c2 cells during Dox treatment. The purpose of the present work was to evaluate Dox-induced morphological alterations in H9c2 myoblasts, focusing especially on the nuclei, mitochondria, and structural fibrous proteins. Treatment of H9c2 cell with low concentrations of Dox causes alterations in fibrous structural proteins including the nuclear lamina and sarcomeric cardiac myosin, as well as mitochondrial depolarization and fragmentation, membrane blebbing with cell shape changes, and phosphatidylserine externalization. For higher Dox concentrations, more profound alterations are evident, including nuclear swelling with disruption of nuclear membrane structure, mitochondrial swelling, and extensive cytoplasm vacuolization. The results obtained indicate that Dox causes morphological alterations in mitochondrial, nuclear, and fibrous protein structures in H9c2 cells, which are dependent on the drug concentration. Data obtained with the present study allow for a better characterization of the effects of Dox on H9c2 myoblasts, used as a model to study Dox-induced cardiotoxicity. The results obtained also provide new and previously unknown targets that can contribute to understand the mechanisms involved in the cardiotoxicity of Dox.},

However, current prediction algorithms have limited predictive power, in part because they were not trained on high-quality epitope datasets covering a broad range of HLA alleles. To enable prediction of endogenous HLA class I-associated peptides across a large fraction of the human population, we used mass spectrometry to profile {$>$}185,000 peptides eluted from 95 HLA-A, -B, -C and -G mono-allelic cell lines. We identified canonical peptide motifs per HLA allele, unique and shared binding submotifs across alleles and distinct motifs associated with different peptide lengths. By integrating these data with transcript abundance and peptide processing, we developed HLAthena, providing allele-and-length-specific and pan-allele-pan-length prediction models for endogenous peptide presentation. These models predicted endogenous HLA class I-associated ligands with 1.5-fold improvement in positive predictive value compared with existing tools and correctly identified {$>$}75\% of HLA-bound peptides that were observed experimentally in 11 patient-derived tumor cell lines.},

Using genotypes from {$>$}9,000 individuals in The Cancer Genome Atlas, we investigated the association of common and rare variants with 139 well-defined immune traits. Our analysis of common variants identified 10 immune traits with significant heritability estimates, and an additional 23 with suggestive heritability, including estimates of T-cell subset abundance and interferon signaling. We performed genome-wide association on the 33 heritable traits and identified 23 genome-wide significant loci associated with at least one immune trait, including SNPs in the IFIH1 locus previously associated with several autoimmune diseases. We also found significant associations between immune traits and pathogenic or likely-pathogenic rare variants in BRCA1 and in genes functionally linked to telomere stabilization, and Wnt/Beta-catenin signaling. We conclude that germline genetic variants significantly impact the composition and functional orientation of the tumor immune microenvironment.},

Northeastern Brazil, although being an important region in terms of human imigration and ethnic admixture, has little information regarding its population mtDNA composition. Here, we determine which mitochondrial lineages contributed to the formation of the Northeastern Brazilian population. Our sample consisted of 767 individuals distributed as follows i) 550 individuals from eight Northeastern states (Piau\'i, Cear\'a, Rio Grande do Norte, Para\'iba, Pernambuco, Alagoas, Sergipe, and Bahia) which were sequenced for mtDNA hypervariable segments I, II, and III; ii) 217 individuals from Alagoas and Pernambuco (previously published data). Data analysis was performed through sequence alignment and Haplogrep 2.0 haplogroup assignment tools. Furthermore, maternal ancestry distribution was contextualized and, when possible, related to historical events to better understand the biological interactions and population dynamics that occurred in this region since the beginning of colonization. RESULTS: Unexpectedly, Amerindian mitochondrial ancestry was the highest in the Northeastern region overall, followed by African, European and non-Amerindian Asian, unlike previous results for this region. Alagoas and Pernambuco states, however, showed a larger African mtDNA frequency. The Northeastern region showed an intraregional heterogeneous distribution regarding ancestral groups, in which states/mesoregions located to the north had a prevalent Amerindian ancestral frequency and those to the south had predominance of African ancestry. Moreover, results showed great diversity of European haplogroups and the presence of non-Amerindian Asian haplogroups. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings are in disagreement with previous investigations that suggest African mitochondrial ancestry is the most prevalent in the Brazilian Northeast. The predominance of Amerindian lineages exemplifies the importance of indigenous women in the formation of the population, despite intense African slave entry and conflicts with European settlers. The variable distribution of ancestral groups observed in the Northeast is in accordance with historical records showing the similarities with colonization dynamics occurred in the Amazon region and the Brazilian Southeast. Moreover, the variety of European haplogroups suggests multiple origins of founding groups, specially those found in Western European populations.},

High-throughput sequencing of short cDNA fragments (RNA-seq) generates a genome-wide snapshot of these post-transcriptional processes. RNA-seq reads yield insights into the regulation of alternative splicing by revealing the usage of known or unknown splice sites as well as the expression level of exons. Constitutive exons are never covered by split alignments, whereas alternative exonic parts are located within highly expressed splicing junctions. The ratio between reads including or excluding exons, also known as percent spliced in index (PSI), indicates how efficiently sequences of interest are spliced into transcripts. This protocol describes a method to calculate the PSI without prior knowledge of splicing patterns. It provides a quantitative, global assessment of exon usage that can be integrated with other tools that identify differential isoform processing. Novel, complex splicing events along a genetic locus can be visualized in an exon-centric manner and compared across conditions.},

While few examples of proteins that aberrantly bind to mutant HTT RNA and execute abnormal function in conjunction with the CAG repeat RNA have been described, an unbiased approach to identify the interactome of mutant HTT RNA is missing. Here, we describe the analysis of proteins that preferentially bind mutant HTT RNA using a mass spectrometry approach. We show that (I) the majority of proteins captured by mutant HTT RNA belong to the spliceosome pathway, (II) expression of mutant CAG repeat RNA induces mis-splicing in a HD cell model, (III) overexpression of one of the splice factors trapped by mutant HTT ameliorates the HD phenotype in a fly model and (VI) deregulated splicing occurs in human HD brain.

In addition to the neurotoxic mutant HTT protein, the mutant CAG repeat RNA can exert toxic functions by trapping RNA-binding proteins. While few examples of proteins that aberrantly bind to mutant HTT RNA and execute abnormal function in conjunction with the CAG repeat RNA have been described, an unbiased approach to identify the interactome of mutant HTT RNA is missing. Here, we describe the analysis of proteins that preferentially bind mutant HTT RNA using a mass spectrometry approach. We show that (I) the majority of proteins captured by mutant HTT RNA belong to the spliceosome pathway, (II) expression of mutant CAG repeat RNA induces mis-splicing in a HD cell model, (III) overexpression of one of the splice factors trapped by mutant HTT ameliorates the HD phenotype in a fly model and (VI) deregulated splicing occurs in human HD brain. Our data suggest that deregulated splicing is a prominent mechanism of RNA-induced toxicity in HD.},

  abstract = {The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has already caused devastating losses. Early evidence shows that the exponential spread of COVID-19 can be slowed by restrictive isolation measures, but these place a tremendous burden on society. Moreover, once these restrictions are lifted, the exponential spread is likely to re-emerge. It has been suggested that populationscale testing can help break the cycle of isolation and spread, but current detection methods are not capable of such large-scale processing. Here we propose LAMP-Seq, a barcoded Reverse-Transcription Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) protocol that could dramatically reduce the cost and complexity of population-scale testing. In this approach, individual samples are processed in a single heat step, producing barcoded amplicons that can be shipped to a sequencing center, pooled, and analyzed en masse. Using unique barcode combinations per sample from a compressed barcode space enables extensive pooling, significantly reducing cost and organizational efforts. Given the low cost and scalability of next-generation sequencing, we believe that this method can be affordably scaled to analyze millions of samples per day using existing sequencing infrastructure.},

However, efficient power analysis methods for single cell data and inter-individual comparisons are lacking. Here, we present scPower; a statistical framework for the design and power analysis of multi-sample single cell transcriptomic experiments. We modelled the relationship between sample size, the number of cells per individual, sequencing depth, and the power of detecting differentially expressed genes within cell types. We systematically evaluated these optimal parameter combinations for several single cell profiling platforms, and generated broad recommendations. In general, shallow sequencing of high numbers of cells leads to higher overall power than deep sequencing of fewer cells. The model, including priors, is implemented as an R package and is accessible as a web tool. scPower is a highly customizable tool that experimentalists can use to quickly compare a multitude of experimental designs and optimize for a limited budget.},

  abstract = {In the past two decades, high-affinity nucleic acid aptamers have been developed for a wide variety of pure molecules and complex systems such as live cells. Conceptually, aptamers are developed by an evolutionary process, whereby, as selection progresses, sequences with a certain conformation capable of binding to the target of interest emerge and dominate the pool. This protocol, cell-SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment), is a method that can generate DNA aptamers that can bind specifically to a cell type of interest. Commonly, a cancer cell line is used as the target to generate aptamers that can differentiate that cell type from other cancers or normal cells. A single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) library pool is incubated with the target cells. Nonbinding sequences are washed off and bound sequences are recovered from the cells by heating cell-DNA complexes at 95 degrees C, followed by centrifugation. The recovered pool is incubated with the control cell line to filter out the sequences that bind to common molecules on both the target and the control, leading to the enrichment of specific binders to the target. Binding sequences are amplified by PCR using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled sense and biotin-labeled antisense primers. This is followed by removal of antisense strands to generate an ssDNA pool for subsequent rounds of selection. The enrichment of the selected pools is monitored by flow cytometry binding assays, with selected pools having increased fluorescence compared with the unselected DNA library. The procedure, from design of oligonucleotides to enrichment of the selected pools, takes approximately 3 months.},

  abstract = {We propose a technique for producing ``visual explanations'' for decisions from a large class of CNN-based models, making them more transparent. Our approach - Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), uses the gradients of any target concept, flowing into the final convolutional layer to produce a coarse localization map highlighting important regions in the image for predicting the concept. Grad-CAM is applicable to a wide variety of CNN model-families: (1) CNNs with fully-connected layers, (2) CNNs used for structured outputs, (3) CNNs used in tasks with multimodal inputs or reinforcement learning, without any architectural changes or re-training. We combine Grad-CAM with fine-grained visualizations to create a high-resolution class-discriminative visualization and apply it to off-the-shelf image classification, captioning, and visual question answering (VQA) models, including ResNet-based architectures. In the context of image classification models, our visualizations (a) lend insights into their failure modes, (b) are robust to adversarial images, (c) outperform previous methods on localization, (d) are more faithful to the underlying model and (e) help achieve generalization by identifying dataset bias. For captioning and VQA, we show that even non-attention based models can localize inputs. We devise a way to identify important neurons through Grad-CAM and combine it with neuron names to provide textual explanations for model decisions. Finally, we design and conduct human studies to measure if Grad-CAM helps users establish appropriate trust in predictions from models and show that Grad-CAM helps untrained users successfully discern a 'stronger' nodel from a 'weaker' one even when both make identical predictions. Our code is available at https://github.com/ramprs/grad-cam/, along with a demo at http://gradcam.cloudcv.org, and a video at youtu.be/COjUB9Izk6E.}

The accompanying Matters Arising paper from Cembrowski and Spruston questions the spatial organization described for CA1 and raise concerns that the results were determined only by high expression, non-barcoded genes. In response, we show that the same robust spatial structure is observed when only lower average abundance genes measured by barcoded seqFISH are used. In fact, many genes with low average abundance are informative of cell states because they can be expressed strongly in specific subpopulation of cells. Our discussion highlights the importance of single-cell in situ analysis in resolving cellular and spatial heterogeneities otherwise lost in population-averaged measurements. This Matters Arising Response paper addresses the Cembrowski and Spruston (2017) Matters Arising paper, published concurrently in this issue of Neuron.},

  abstract = {Recent molecular studies have shown that, even when derived from a seemingly homogenous population, individual cells can exhibit substantial differences in gene expression, protein levels and phenotypic output, with important functional consequences. Existing studies of cellular heterogeneity, however, have typically measured only a few pre-selected RNAs or proteins simultaneously, because genomic profiling methods could not be applied to single cells until very recently. Here we use single-cell RNA sequencing to investigate heterogeneity in the response of mouse bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) to lipopolysaccharide. We find extensive, and previously unobserved, bimodal variation in messenger RNA abundance and splicing patterns, which we validate by RNA-fluorescence in situ hybridization for select transcripts. In particular, hundreds of key immune genes are bimodally expressed across cells, surprisingly even for genes that are very highly expressed at the population average. Moreover, splicing patterns demonstrate previously unobserved levels of heterogeneity between cells. Some of the observed bimodality can be attributed to closely related, yet distinct, known maturity states of BMDCs; other portions reflect differences in the usage of key regulatory circuits. For example, we identify a module of 137 highly variable, yet co-regulated, antiviral response genes. Using cells from knockout mice, we show that variability in this module may be propagated through an interferon feedback circuit, involving the transcriptional regulators Stat2 and Irf7. Our study demonstrates the power and promise of single-cell genomics in uncovering functional diversity between cells and in deciphering cell states and circuits.},

Loss of protein-coding genes is one type of genomic change with the potential to affect phenotypic evolution. Here, we develop a genomics approach to accurately detect gene losses and investigate their importance for adaptive evolution in mammals. We discover a number of gene losses that likely contributed to morphological, physiological, and metabolic adaptations in aquatic and flying mammals. These gene losses shed light on possible molecular and cellular mechanisms that underlie these adaptive phenotypes. In addition, we show that gene loss events that occur as a consequence of relaxed selection following adaptation provide novel insights into species' biology. Our results suggest that gene loss is an evolutionary mechanism for adaptation that may be more widespread than previously anticipated. Hence, investigating gene losses has great potential to reveal the genomic basis underlying macroevolutionary changes.},

This anti-cancer drug has various side effects, such as allergic reactions, cardiac damage, hair loss, bone marrow suppression, vomiting, and bladder irritation. The most dangerous side effect of doxorubicin is cardiomyopathy, leading to congestive heart failure. The exact mechanisms of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity remain incompletely understood. Alteration in myocardial structure and functional cardiac disorders is provoked by doxorubicin administration; subsequently, cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure can occur. Congestive heart failure due to doxorubicin is associated with mortality and morbidity. Probably, doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity starts from myocardial cell injury and is followed by left ventricular dysfunction. Many factors and multiple pathways are responsible for the creation of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. Inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress pathways, mitochondrial damage, intracellular Ca2+ overload, iron-free radical production, DNA, and myocyte membrane injuries have critical roles in the pathophysiology of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. Unfortunately, there are currently a few medications for the treatment of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in clinical settings. Extensive basic and clinical researches have been carried out to discover preventive treatments. This review briefly discusses the basic and experimental approaches for treating or preventing doxorubicin-mediated cardiotoxicity based on its pathophysiological mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Diagnostic accuracy relates to the ability of a test to discriminate between the target condition and health. This discriminative potential can be quantified by the measures of diagnostic accuracy such as sensitivity and specificity, predictive values, likelihood ratios, the area under the ROC curve, Youden's index and diagnostic odds ratio. Different measures of diagnostic accuracy relate to the different aspects of diagnostic procedure: while some measures are used to assess the discriminative property of the test, others are used to assess its predictive ability. Measures of diagnostic accuracy are not fixed indicators of a test performance, some are very sensitive to the disease prevalence, while others to the spectrum and definition of the disease. Furthermore, measures of diagnostic accuracy are extremely sensitive to the design of the study. Studies not meeting strict methodological standards usually over- or under-estimate the indicators of test performance as well as they limit the applicability of the results of the study. STARD initiative was a very important step toward the improvement the quality of reporting of studies of diagnostic accuracy. STARD statement should be included into the Instructions to authors by scientific journals and authors should be encouraged to use the checklist whenever reporting their studies on diagnostic accuracy. Such efforts could make a substantial difference in the quality of reporting of studies of diagnostic accuracy and serve to provide the best possible evidence to the best for the patient care. This brief review outlines some basic definitions and characteristics of the measures of diagnostic accuracy.},

  abstract = {The risk of cardiotoxicity is the most serious drawback to the clinical usefulness of anthracycline antineoplastic antibiotics, which include doxorubicin (adriamycin), daunorubicin or epirubicin. Nevertheless, these compounds remain among the most widely used anticancer drugs. The molecular pathogenesis of anthracycline cardiotoxicity remains highly controversial, although the oxidative stress-based hypothesis involving intramyocardial production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) has gained the widest acceptance. Anthracyclines may promote the formation of ROS through redox cycling of their aglycones as well as their anthracycline-iron complexes. This proposed mechanism has become particularly popular in light of the high cardioprotective efficacy of dexrazoxane (ICRF-187). The mechanism of action of this drug has been attributed to its hydrolytic transformation into the iron-chelating metabolite ADR-925, which may act by displacing iron from anthracycline-iron complexes or by chelating free or loosely bound cellular iron, thus preventing site-specific iron-catalyzed ROS damage. However, during the last decade, calls for the critical reassessment of this ``ROS and iron'' hypothesis have emerged. Numerous antioxidants, although efficient in cellular or acute animal experiments, have failed to alleviate anthracycline cardiotoxicity in clinically relevant chronic animal models or clinical trials. In addition, studies with chelators that are stronger and more selective for iron than ADR-925 have also yielded negative or, at best, mixed outcomes. Hence, several lines of evidence suggest that mechanisms other than the traditionally emphasized ``ROS and iron'' hypothesis are involved in anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity and that these alternative mechanisms may be better bases for designing approaches to achieve efficient and safe cardioprotection.},

However, owing to the unique statistical properties of scRNA-seq data, the optimal measures of association for identifying gene-gene and cell-cell relationships from single-cell transcriptomics remain unclear. Here, we conducted a large-scale evaluation of 17 measures of association for their ability to reconstruct cellular networks, cluster cells of the same type and link cell-type-specific transcriptional programs to disease. Measures of proportionality were consistently among the best-performing methods across datasets and tasks.

Prehistoric genomes now document population transformations on every inhabited continent-in particular the effect of agricultural expansions in Africa, Europe, and Oceania-and record a history of natural selection that shapes present-day phenotypic diversity. Despite these advances, much remains unknown, in particular about the genomic histories of Asia (the most populous continent) and Africa (the continent that contains the most genetic diversity). Ancient genomes from these and other regions, integrated with a growing understanding of the genomic basis of human phenotypic diversity, will be in focus during the next decade of research in the field.},

We developed subcellular TimeLapse-seq to measure the rates at which RNAs are released from chromatin, exported from the nucleus, loaded onto polysomes, and degraded within the nucleus and cytoplasm. These rates varied substantially, yet transcripts from genes with related functions or targeted by the same transcription factors and RNA binding proteins flowed across subcellular compartments with similar kinetics. Verifying these associations uncovered roles for DDX3X and PABPC4 in nuclear export. For hundreds of genes, most transcripts were degraded within the nucleus, while the remaining molecules were exported and persisted with stable lifespans. Transcripts residing on chromatin for longer had extended poly(A) tails, whereas the reverse was observed for cytoplasmic mRNAs. Finally, a machine learning model identified additional molecular features that underlie the diverse life cycles of mammalian mRNAs.},

Ipilimumab and tremelimumab are antibodies against cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4). Anti-CTLA-4 treatment prolongs overall survival in patients with melanoma. CTLA-4 blockade activates T cells and enables them to destroy tumor cells. METHODS: We obtained tumor tissue from patients with melanoma who were treated with ipilimumab or tremelimumab. Whole-exome sequencing was performed on tumors and matched blood samples. Somatic mutations and candidate neoantigens generated from these mutations were characterized. Neoantigen peptides were tested for the ability to activate lymphocytes from ipilimumab-treated patients. RESULTS: Malignant melanoma exomes from 64 patients treated with CTLA-4 blockade were characterized with the use of massively parallel sequencing. A discovery set consisted of 11 patients who derived a long-term clinical benefit and 14 patients who derived a minimal benefit or no benefit. Mutational load was associated with the degree of clinical benefit (P=0.01) but alone was not sufficient to predict benefit. Using genomewide somatic neoepitope analysis and patient-specific HLA typing, we identified candidate tumor neoantigens for each patient. We elucidated a neoantigen landscape that is specifically present in tumors with a strong response to CTLA-4 blockade. We validated this signature in a second set of 39 patients with melanoma who were treated with anti-CTLA-4 antibodies. Predicted neoantigens activated T cells from the patients treated with ipilimumab. CONCLUSIONS: These findings define a genetic basis for benefit from CTLA-4 blockade in melanoma and provide a rationale for examining exomes of patients for whom anti-CTLA-4 agents are being considered.

ANP also has an anti-hypertrophic function in the heart, which is independent of its systemic blood pressure-lowering effect. In mice, ANP deficiency causes salt-sensitive hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy. Recent studies have shown that ANP plays an important role in regulating vascular remodeling and energy metabolism. Variants in the human NPPA gene, encoding the ANP precursor, are associated with hypertension, stroke, coronary artery disease, heart failure (HF) and obesity. ANP and related peptides are used as biomarkers for heart disease. Recombinant proteins and small molecules that enhance the ANP pathway have been developed to treat patients with HF.

Leveraging the growing repository of labeled datasets and transferring labels from existing datasets to newly generated datasets will empower the exploration of single-cell omics data. However, the current label transfer methods have limited performance, largely due to the intrinsic heterogeneity among cell populations and extrinsic differences between datasets. Here, we present a robust graph artificial intelligence model, single-cell Graph Convolutional Network (scGCN), to achieve effective knowledge transfer across disparate datasets. Through benchmarking with other label transfer methods on a total of 30 single cell omics datasets, scGCN consistently demonstrates superior accuracy on leveraging cells from different tissues, platforms, and species, as well as cells profiled at different molecular layers. scGCN is implemented as an integrated workflow as a python software, which is available at               https://github.com/QSong-github/scGCN               .},

Here, we present an approach to simultaneously capture host and pathogen spatial gene expression information from the same formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue section using the spatial transcriptomics technology. We applied the method to COVID-19 patient lung samples and enabled the dual detection of human and SARS-CoV-2 transcriptomes at 55 {$\mu$}m resolution. We validated our spatial detection of SARS-CoV-2 and identified an average specificity of 94.92\% in comparison to RNAScope and 82.20\% in comparison to             in situ             sequencing (ISS). COVID-19 tissues showed an upregulation of host immune response, such as increased expression of inflammatory cytokines, lymphocyte and fibroblast markers. Our colocalization analysis revealed that SARS-CoV-2             +             spots presented shifts in host RNA metabolism, autophagy, NF{$\kappa$}B, and interferon response pathways. Future applications of our approach will enable new insights into host response to pathogen infection through the simultaneous, unbiased detection of two transcriptomes.},

  author = {Spitzer, Hannah and Berry, Scott and Donoghoe, Mark and Pelkmans, Lucas and Theis, Fabian J},
  abstract = {Highly multiplexed quantitative subcellular imaging holds enormous promise for understanding how spatial context shapes the activity of our genome and its products at multiple scales. Yet unbiased analysis of subcellular organisation across experimental conditions remains challenging, because differences in molecular profiles between conditions confound differences in molecular profiles across space. Here, we introduce a deep-learning framework called CAMPA (Conditional Autoencoder for Multiplexed Pixel Analysis), which uses a variational autoencoder conditioned on cellular states and perturbations to learn consistent molecular signatures. Clustering the learned representations into subcellular landmarks allows quantitative comparisons of landmark sizes, shapes, molecular compositions and relative spatial organisation between conditions. By performing high-resolution multiplexed immunofluorescence on human cells, we use CAMPA to reveal how subnuclear organisation changes upon different perturbations of RNA production or processing, and how different membraneless organelles scale with cell size. Furthermore, by integrating information across the cellular and subcellular scales, we uncover new links between the molecular composition of membraneless organelles and bulk RNA synthesis rates of single cells. We anticipate that CAMPA will greatly accelerate the systematic mapping of multiscale atlases of biological organisation to identify the rules by which context shapes physiology and disease.},

Until today there has been no exact solution. A method of shedding some light to this question is presented in this paper. A near?optimal solution is discovered after searching with a genetic algorithm. A novel fitness function is introduced that concurrently seeks for the most accurate and compact solution. The proposed method is thoroughly compared to many other methods currently in use, including several heuristics and pruning algorithms. The results are encouraging, indicating that it is time to shift our focus from suboptimal practices to efficient search methods, to tune the parameters of neural networks.}

However, tools to quantitatively study cellular patterning and tissue architecture are currently lacking. Here, we develop a spatial analysis toolbox, the histo-cytometric multidimensional analysis pipeline (CytoMAP), which incorporates data clustering, positional correlation, dimensionality reduction, and 2D/3D region reconstruction to identify localized cellular networks and reveal features of tissue organization. We apply CytoMAP to study the microanatomy of innate immune subsets in murine lymph nodes (LNs) and reveal mutually exclusive segregation of migratory dendritic cells (DCs), regionalized compartmentalization of SIRPa\`A dermal DCs, and preferential association of resident DCs with select LN vasculature. The findings provide insights into the organization of myeloid cells in LNs and demonstrate that CytoMAP is a comprehensive analytics toolbox for revealing features of tissue organization in imaging datasets.},

  abstract = {Single cell transcriptomics (scRNA-seq) has transformed our ability to discover and annotate cell types and states, but deep biological understanding requires more than a taxonomic listing of clusters. As new methods arise to measure distinct cellular modalities, including high-dimensional immunophenotypes, chromatin accessibility, and spatial positioning, a key analytical challenge is to integrate these datasets into a harmonized atlas that can be used to better understand cellular identity and function. Here, we develop a computational strategy to ``anchor'' diverse datasets together, enabling us to integrate and compare single cell measurements not only across scRNA-seq technologies, but different modalities as well. After demonstrating substantial improvement over existing methods for data integration, we anchor scRNA-seq experiments with scATAC-seq datasets to explore chromatin differences in closely related interneuron subsets, and project single cell protein measurements onto a human bone marrow atlas to annotate and characterize lymphocyte populations. Lastly, we demonstrate how anchoring can harmonize             in-situ             gene expression and scRNA-seq datasets, allowing for the transcriptome-wide imputation of spatial gene expression patterns, and the identification of spatial relationships between mapped cell types in the visual cortex. Our work presents a strategy for comprehensive integration of single cell data, including the assembly of harmonized references, and the transfer of information across datasets.

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: The composition and density of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) profoundly influence tumor progression and success of anti-cancer therapies. Flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry staining or single-cell sequencing are often unavailable such that we rely on computational methods to estimate the immune-cell composition from bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data. Various methods have been proposed recently, yet their capabilities and limitations have not been evaluated systematically. A general guideline leading the research community through cell type deconvolution is missing. RESULTS: We developed a systematic approach for benchmarking such computational methods and assessed the accuracy of tools at estimating nine different immune- and stromal cells from bulk RNA-seq samples. We used a single-cell RNA-seq dataset of {$\sim$}11 000 cells from the TME to simulate bulk samples of known cell type proportions, and validated the results using independent, publicly available gold-standard estimates. This allowed us to analyze and condense the results of more than a hundred thousand predictions to provide an exhaustive evaluation across seven computational methods over nine cell types and {$\sim$}1800 samples from five simulated and real-world datasets. We demonstrate that computational deconvolution performs at high accuracy for well-defined cell-type signatures and propose how fuzzy cell-type signatures can be improved. We suggest that future efforts should be dedicated to refining cell population definitions and finding reliable signatures. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: A snakemake pipeline to reproduce the benchmark is available at https://github.com/grst/immune\_deconvolution\_benchmark. An R package allows the community to perform integrated deconvolution using different methods (https://grst.github.io/immunedeconv). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Our understanding of 3D genome organization requires tools to directly visualize chromatin conformation in its native context. Here we report an imaging technology for visualizing chromatin organization across multiple scales in single cells with high genomic throughput. First we demonstrate multiplexed imaging of hundreds of genomic loci by sequential hybridization, which allows high-resolution conformation tracing of whole chromosomes. Next we report a multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH)-based method for genome-scale chromatin tracing and demonstrate simultaneous imaging of more than 1,000 genomic loci and nascent transcripts of more than 1,000 genes together with landmark nuclear structures. Using this technology, we characterize chromatin domains, compartments, and trans-chromosomal interactions and their relationship to transcription in single cells. We envision broad application of this high-throughput, multi-scale, and multimodal imaging technology, which provides an integrated view of chromatin organization in its native structural and functional context.},

They have important functions in cell development and metabolism, such as genetic markers, genome rearrangements, chromatin modifications, cell cycle regulation, transcription and translation. Their functions are generally closely related to their localization in the cell. Therefore, knowledge about their subcellular locations can provide very useful clues or preliminary insight into their biological functions. Although biochemical experiments could determine the localization of lncRNAs in a cell, they are both time-consuming and expensive. Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop bioinformatics tools for fast and effective identification of their subcellular locations. Results: We developed a sequence-based bioinformatics tool called 'iLoc-lncRNA' to predict the subcellular locations of LncRNAs by incorporating the 8-tuple nucleotide features into the general PseKNC (Pseudo K-tuple Nucleotide Composition) via the binomial distribution approach. Rigorous jackknife tests have shown that the overall accuracy achieved by the new predictor on a stringent benchmark dataset is 86.72\%, which is over 20\% higher than that by the existing state-of-the-art predictor evaluated on the same tests. Availability and implementation: A user-friendly webserver has been established at http://lin-group.cn/server/iLoc-LncRNA, by which users can easily obtain their desired results.

We combined two approaches for large-scale classification of fluorescence microscopy images. First, using the publicly available data set from the Cell Atlas of the Human Protein Atlas (HPA), we integrated an image-classification task into a mainstream video game (EVE Online) as a mini-game, named Project Discovery. Participation by 322,006 gamers over 1 year provided nearly 33 million classifications of subcellular localization patterns, including patterns that were not previously annotated by the HPA. Second, we used deep learning to build an automated Localization Cellular Annotation Tool (Loc-CAT). This tool classifies proteins into 29 subcellular localization patterns and can deal efficiently with multi-localization proteins, performing robustly across different cell types. Combining the annotations of gamers and deep learning, we applied transfer learning to create a boosted learner that can characterize subcellular protein distribution with F1 score of 0.72. We found that engaging players of commercial computer games provided data that augmented deep learning and enabled scalable and readily improved image classification.},

They are generally obtained by SELEX, but the procedure is challenging and time-consuming. Moreover, the identified aptamers tend to be insufficient in stability, specificity, and affinity. Thus, only a handful of aptamers have entered the practical use stage. Recently, computational approaches have demonstrated a significant capacity to assist in the discovery of high-performance aptamers. This review discusses the advances achieved in several aspects of computational tools in this field, as well as the new progress in machine learning and deep learning, which are used in aptamer identification and optimization. To illustrate these computationally aided processes, aptamer selections against SARS-CoV-2 are discussed in detail as a case study. We hope that this review will aid and motivate researchers to develop and utilize more computational techniques to discover ideal aptamers effectively.},

  abstract = {Identifying the relationships between chromosome structures, chromatin states, and gene expression is an overarching goal of nuclear organization studies. Because individual cells are highly variable at all three levels, it is essential to map all three modalities in the same single cell, a task that has been difficult to accomplish with existing tools. Here, we report the direct super-resolution imaging of over 3,660 chromosomal loci in single mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) by DNA seqFISH+, along with 17 chromatin marks by sequential immunofluorescence (IF) and the expression profile of 70 RNAs, in the same cells. We discovered that the nucleus is separated into zones defined by distinct combinatorial chromatin marks. DNA loci and nascent transcripts are enriched at the interfaces between specific nuclear zones, and the level of gene expression correlates with an association between active or nuclear speckle zones. Our analysis also uncovered several distinct mESCs subpopulations with characteristic combinatorial chromatin states that extend beyond known transcriptional states, suggesting that the metastable states of mESCs are more complex than previously appreciated. Using clonal analysis, we show that the global levels of some chromatin marks, such as H3K27me3 and macroH2A1 (mH2A1), are heritable over at least 3-4 generations, whereas other marks fluctuate on a faster time scale. The longlived chromatin states may represent ``hidden variables'' that explain the observed functional heterogeneity in differentiation decisions in single mESCs. Our integrated spatial genomics approach can be used to further explore the existence and biological relevance of molecular heterogeneity within cell populations in diverse biological systems.},

FMRP is a cytoplasmic RNA-binding protein which cosediments with the 60S ribosomal subunit. Recently, two proteins homologous to FMRP were discovered: FXR1 and FXR2. These novel proteins interact with FMRP and with each other and they are also associated with the 60S ribosomal subunit. Here, we studied the expression pattern of the three proteins in brain and testis by immunohistochemistry. In adult brain, FMR1, FXR1 and FXR2 proteins are coexpressed in the cytoplasm of specific differentiated neurons only. However, we observed a different expression pattern in fetal brain as well as in adult and fetal testis, suggesting independent functions for the three proteins in those tissues during embryonic development and adult life.},

Focus has shifted from clinical parameters to molecular markers, such as expression of specific genes and selected genomic abnormalities, to improve accuracy of treatment outcome prediction. Here, we show how integration of high-level clinical and genomic features or risk factors, including disease subtype, can yield more comprehensive, accurate, and biologically interpretable prediction models for relapse versus no-relapse classification. We also introduce a novel Bayesian nomogram indicating the amount of evidence that each feature contributes on a patient-by-patient basis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A Bayesian cumulative log-odds model of outcome was developed from a training cohort of 96 children treated for medulloblastoma, starting with the evidence provided by clinical features of metastasis and histology (model A) and incrementally adding the evidence from gene-expression-derived features representing disease subtype-independent (model B) and disease subtype-dependent (model C) pathways, and finally high-level copy-number genomic abnormalities (model D). The models were validated on an independent test cohort (n = 78). RESULTS: On an independent multi-institutional test data set, models A to D attain an area under receiver operating characteristic (au-ROC) curve of 0.73 (95\% CI, 0.60 to 0.84), 0.75 (95\% CI, 0.64 to 0.86), 0.80 (95\% CI, 0.70 to 0.90), and 0.78 (95\% CI, 0.68 to 0.88), respectively, for predicting relapse versus no relapse. CONCLUSION: The proposed models C and D outperform the current clinical classification schema (au-ROC, 0.68), our previously published eight-gene outcome signature (au-ROC, 0.71), and several new schemas recently proposed in the literature for medulloblastoma risk stratification.},

We report nanopore sequencing of full-length cDNA from CLL samples with and without               SF3B1               mutation, as well as normal B cell samples, giving a total of 149 million pass reads. We present FLAIR (Full-Length Alternative Isoform analysis of RNA), a computational workflow to identify high-confidence transcripts, perform differential splicing event analysis, and differential isoform analysis. Using nanopore reads, we demonstrate differential 3' splice site changes associated with               SF3B1               mutation, agreeing with previous studies. We also observe a strong downregulation of intron retention events associated with               SF3B1               mutation. Full-length transcript analysis links multiple alternative splicing events together and allows for better estimates of the abundance of productive versus unproductive isoforms.

  abstract = {Adriamycin (doxorubicin), a potent antitumor drug in clinical use, interacts with nucleic acids and cell membranes, but the molecular basis for its antitumor activity is unknown. Similar to a number of intercalative antitumor drugs and nonintercalative epipodophyllotoxins (VP-16 and VM-26), adriamycin has been shown to induce single- and double-strand breaks in DNA. These strand breaks are unusual because a covalently bound protein appears to be associated with each broken phosphodiester bond. In studies in vitro, mammalian DNA topoisomerase II mediates DNA damage by adriamycin and other related antitumor drugs.},

  abstract = {The Gene Ontology Consortium (GOC) provides the most comprehensive resource currently available for computable knowledge regarding the functions of genes and gene products. Here, we report the advances of the consortium over the past two years. The new GO-CAM annotation framework was notably improved, and we formalized the model with a computational schema to check and validate the rapidly increasing repository of 2838 GO-CAMs. In addition, we describe the impacts of several collaborations to refine GO and report a 10\% increase in the number of GO annotations, a 25\% increase in annotated gene products, and over 9,400 new scientific articles annotated. As the project matures, we continue our efforts to review older annotations in light of newer findings, and, to maintain consistency with other ontologies. As a result, 20 000 annotations derived from experimental data were reviewed, corresponding to 2.5\% of experimental GO annotations. The website (http://geneontology.org) was redesigned for quick access to documentation, downloads and tools. To maintain an accurate resource and support traceability and reproducibility, we have made available a historical archive covering the past 15 years of GO data with a consistent format and file structure for both the ontology and annotations.},

  abstract = {As neurons are one of the most highly polarized cells in our body, they require sophisticated cellular mechanisms to maintain protein homeostasis in their subcellular compartments such as axons and dendrites. When neuronal protein homeostasis is disturbed due to genetic mutations or deletions, this often results in degeneration of neurons leading to devastating outcome such as spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and fragile X syndrome (FXS). Ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes are macromolecular complexes composed of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) and their target RNAs. RBPs contain RNA binding domains and bind to RNA molecules via specific sequence motifs. RNP complexes have various functions in gene expression including messenger RNA (mRNA) trafficking, RNA processing and silencing. In neurons, RBPs deliver specific sets of mRNAs to subcellular compartments such as axons and dendrites to be locally translated. Mutations or deletions in genes coding for RNPs have been reported as causes for neurological disorders such as SMA, ALS, and FXS. As RBPs determine axonal or dendritic mRNA repertoires as well as proteomes by trafficking selective mRNAs and regulating local protein synthesis, they play a crucial role for neuronal function. In this review, we summarize the role of well-known RBPs, SMN, TDP-43, FUS, and FMRP, and review their function for local protein synthesis in neurons. Furthermore, we discuss their pathological contribution to the neurological disorders.},

Many complexities such as heterogeneous shape of cells/nuclei, overlapping cells, presence of background noise, and variability in staining and illumination conditions make automated analysis of microscopic images, a complicated problem. Cell detection is the most basic and essential step for analysis of microscopic cell images. Even though many methods have been proposed over the years, ongoing research has failed to develop a system which is both generic and trainable for a wider range of applications with sensitivity and accuracy. Hence, novel automated methods are necessary. This paper examines and analyses various automated methods for cell detection and segmentation.},

  abstract = {Summary We performed an extensive immunogenomic analysis of more than 10,000 tumors comprising 33 diverse cancer types by utilizing data compiled by TCGA. Across cancer types, we identified six immune subtypes\textemdash wound healing, IFN-{$\gamma$} dominant, inflammatory, lymphocyte depleted, immunologically quiet, and TGF-{$\beta$} dominant\textemdash characterized by differences in macrophage or lymphocyte signatures, Th1:Th2 cell ratio, extent of intratumoral heterogeneity, aneuploidy, extent of neoantigen load, overall cell proliferation, expression of immunomodulatory genes, and prognosis. Specific driver mutations correlated with lower (CTNNB1, NRAS, or IDH1) or higher (BRAF, TP53, or CASP8) leukocyte levels across all cancers. Multiple control modalities of the intracellular and extracellular networks (transcription, microRNAs, copy number, and epigenetic processes) were involved in tumor-immune cell interactions, both across and within immune subtypes. Our immunogenomics pipeline to characterize these heterogeneous tumors and the resulting data are intended to serve as a resource for future targeted studies to further advance the field.},

  abstract = {Summary We performed an extensive immunogenomic analysis of more than 10,000 tumors comprising 33 diverse cancer types by utilizing data compiled by TCGA. Across cancer types, we identified six immune subtypes\textemdash wound healing, IFN-{$\gamma$} dominant, inflammatory, lymphocyte depleted, immunologically quiet, and TGF-{$\beta$} dominant\textemdash characterized by differences in macrophage or lymphocyte signatures, Th1:Th2 cell ratio, extent of intratumoral heterogeneity, aneuploidy, extent of neoantigen load, overall cell proliferation, expression of immunomodulatory genes, and prognosis. Specific driver mutations correlated with lower (CTNNB1, NRAS, or IDH1) or higher (BRAF, TP53, or CASP8) leukocyte levels across all cancers. Multiple control modalities of the intracellular and extracellular networks (transcription, microRNAs, copy number, and epigenetic processes) were involved in tumor-immune cell interactions, both across and within immune subtypes. Our immunogenomics pipeline to characterize these heterogeneous tumors and the resulting data are intended to serve as a resource for future targeted studies to further advance the field.}

  abstract = {Mapping the proteome                            Proteins function in the context of their environment, so an understanding of cellular processes requires a knowledge of protein localization. Thul               et al.               used immunofluorescence microscopy to map 12,003 human proteins at a single-cell level into 30 cellular compartments and substructures (see the Perspective by Horwitz and Johnson). They validated their results by mass spectroscopy and used them to model and refine protein-protein interaction networks. The cellular proteome is highly spatiotemporally regulated. Many proteins localize to multiple compartments, and many show cell-to-cell variation in their expression patterns. Presented as an interactive database called the Cell Atlas, this work provides an important resource for ongoing efforts to understand human biology.                                         Science               , this issue p.               eaal3321               ; see also p.               806                        ,              The image-based Cell Atlas of 12,003 proteins and 13 organelles reveals proteins that exhibit multiple localizations and single-cell variation.           ,                             INTRODUCTION               A complete view of human biology can only be achieved by studying the molecular components of its smallest functional unit, the cell. Cells are internally organized into compartments called organelles. The spatial partitioning provided by organelles creates an enclosed environment or surface for chemical reactions tailored to fulfill specific functions. These functions are tightly linked to a specific set of proteins. Therefore, resolving the subcellular location of the human proteome provides information about the function of the organelle and its underlying cellular mechanisms. We present a subcellular map of the human proteome, called the Cell Atlas, to facilitate functional exploration of individual proteins and their role in human biology and disease.                                         RATIONALE               Immunofluorescence (IF) microscopy was used to systematically resolve the spatial distribution of human proteins in cultivated cell lines and map them to cellular compartments and substructures with single-cell resolution. This approach allowed definition of the precise location of a majority of the human proteins in their cellular context and exploration of single-cell variations in protein expression patterns. The proteome-wide information about protein spatial distribution was validated with an orthogonal proteomics method, and the results were integrated into existing network models of protein-protein interactions for increased accuracy.                                         RESULTS               We report a high-resolution characterization of the spatial subcellular distribution of the human proteome based on more than 80,000 confocal IF images. A total of 12,003 proteins targeted by 13,993 antibodies were classified into one or several of 30 cellular compartments and substructures, altogether defining the proteomes of 13 major organelles. The organelles with the largest proteomes were the nucleus and its substructures (6245 proteins), such as bodies and speckles, and the cytosol (4279 proteins). However, smaller organelles such as the midbody, rods and rings, and nucleoli also showed a larger diversity than previously recognized. Intriguingly, about half of all proteins were localized to multiple compartments, showing that there is a shared pool of proteins even among functionally unrelated organelles. Single-cell analysis revealed 1855 proteins with variation in their expression pattern, either in terms of expression levels or spatial distribution. Last, the spatial information was used to refine biological networks. Our location-pruned network that restricts protein interaction to the same organelle improved the accuracy of the human interactome model. The analysis also included transcriptomics data for all putative protein-coding genes (19,628) in 56 human cell lines of various origins. On average, cell lines expressed 11,490 genes, with half of them (6295) being expressed across all samples, suggesting a ``housekeeping'' role.                                         CONCLUSION                                The cellular proteome is compartmentalized and spatiotemporally regulated to a high degree. The high-resolution subcellular map of the human proteome that we provide describes this cellular complexity, with many multilocalizing proteins and single-cell variations. The map is presented as an interactive database called the Cell Atlas, part of the Human Protein Atlas (                 www.proteinatlas.org                 ). The Cell Atlas constitutes a key resource for a holistic understanding of the human cell and its complex underlying molecular machinery, as well as a major step toward modeling the human cell.                                                                  Creation of an image-based map of the human subcellular proteome.                   The subcellular locations of 12,003 proteins were determined by IF microscopy in cell lines of various origins. High-resolution IF images such as those shown above enabled mapping of proteins to distinct subcellular structures. This resulted in the definition of the proteomes of 13 major cellular organelles, revealing multilocalizing proteins, as well as expression variability on a single-cell level.                                                                         ,              Resolving the spatial distribution of the human proteome at a subcellular level can greatly increase our understanding of human biology and disease. Here we present a comprehensive image-based map of subcellular protein distribution, the Cell Atlas, built by integrating transcriptomics and antibody-based immunofluorescence microscopy with validation by mass spectrometry. Mapping the in situ localization of 12,003 human proteins at a single-cell level to 30 subcellular structures enabled the definition of the proteomes of 13 major organelles. Exploration of the proteomes revealed single-cell variations in abundance or spatial distribution and localization of about half of the proteins to multiple compartments. This subcellular map can be used to refine existing protein-protein interaction networks and provides an important resource to deconvolute the highly complex architecture of the human cell.},

  abstract = {RNA granules are ubiquitous. Composed of RNA-binding proteins and RNAs, they provide functional compartmentalization within cells. They are inextricably linked with RNA biology and as such are often referred to as the hubs for post-transcriptional regulation. Much of the attention has been given to the proteins that form these condensates and thus many fundamental questions about the biology of RNA granules remain poorly understood: How and which RNAs enrich in RNA granules, how are transcripts regulated in them, and how do granule-enriched mRNAs shape the biology of a cell? In this review, we discuss the imaging, genetic, and biochemical data, which have revealed that some aspects of the RNA biology within granules are carried out by the RNA itself rather than the granule proteins. Interestingly, the RNA structure has emerged as an important feature in the post-transcriptional control of granule transcripts. This review is part of the Special Issue in the Frontiers in RNA structure in the journal Molecules.},

To dissect the underlying mechanisms, we combined an engineered ascorbic acid peroxidase (APEX) approach with quantitative affinity purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS) followed by proximity ligation assay (PLA) to characterize Tau interactomes modified by neuronal activity and mutations that cause frontotemporal dementia (FTD) in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons. We established interactions of Tau with presynaptic vesicle proteins during activity-dependent Tau secretion and mapped the Tau-binding sites to the cytosolic domains of integral synaptic vesicle proteins. We showed that FTD mutations impair bioenergetics and markedly diminished Tau's interaction with mitochondria proteins, which were downregulated in AD brains of multiple cohorts and correlated with disease severity. These multimodal and dynamic Tau interactomes with exquisite spatial resolution shed light on Tau's role in neuronal function and disease and highlight potential therapeutic targets to block Tau-mediated pathogenesis.},

To identify genomic regions crucial to corticogenesis, we mapped the activity of gene-regulatory elements generating a single-cell atlas of gene expression and chromatin accessibility both independently and jointly. This revealed waves of gene regulation by key transcription factors (TFs) across a nearly continuous differentiation trajectory, distinguished the expression programs of glial lineages, and identified lineage-determining TFs that exhibited strong correlation between linked gene-regulatory elements and expression levels. These highly connected genes adopted an active chromatin state in early differentiating cells, consistent with lineage commitment. Base-pair-resolution neural network models identified strong cell-type-specific enrichment of noncoding mutations predicted to be disruptive in a cohort of ASD individuals and identified frequently disrupted TF binding sites. This approach illustrates how cell-type-specific mapping can provide insights into the programs governing human development and disease.},

Here we present SUPPA2, a new method that addresses these challenges, and enables streamlined analysis across multiple conditions taking into account biological variability. Using experimental and simulated data, we show that SUPPA2 achieves higher accuracy compared to other methods, especially at low sequencing depth and short read length. We use SUPPA2 to identify novel Transformer2-regulated exons, novel microexons induced during differentiation of bipolar neurons, and novel intron retention events during erythroblast differentiation.},

  abstract = {The Sequence Read Archive (SRA) contains over one million publicly available sequencing runs from various studies using a variety of sequencing library strategies. These data inherently contain information about underlying genomic sequence variants which we exploit to extract allelic read counts on an unprecedented scale. We reprocessed over 250,000 human sequencing runs ({$>$}1000 TB data worth of raw sequence data) into a single unified dataset of allelic read counts for nearly 300,000 variants of biomedical relevance curated by NCBI dbSNP, where germline variants were detected in a median of 912 sequencing runs, and somatic variants were detected in a median of 4,876 sequencing runs, suggesting that this dataset facilitates identification of sequencing runs that harbor variants of interest. Allelic read counts obtained using a targeted alignment were very similar to read counts obtained from whole genome alignment. Analyzing allelic read count data for matched DNA and RNA samples from tumors, we find that RNA-seq can also recover variants identified by WXS, suggesting that reprocessed allelic read counts can support variant detection across different library strategies in SRA. This study provides a rich database of known human variants across SRA samples that can support future meta-analyses of human sequence variation.},

Networks of functionally coordinated and biologically important alternative splicing events continue to be discovered in an ever-increasing diversity of cell types in the context of physiologically normal and disease states. These studies have been complemented by efforts directed at defining sequence codes governing splicing and their cognate trans-acting factors, which have illuminated important combinatorial principles of regulation. Additional studies have revealed critical roles of position-dependent, multivalent protein-RNA interactions that direct splicing outcomes. Investigations of evolutionary changes in RNA binding proteins, splice variants, and associated cis elements have further shed light on the emergence, mechanisms, and functions of splicing networks. Progress in these areas has emphasized the need for a coordinated, community-based effort to systematically address the functions of individual splice variants associated with normal and disease biology.},

  abstract = {Abstract             A common analysis of single-cell sequencing data includes clustering of cells and identifying differentially expressed genes (DEGs). How cell clusters are defined has important consequences for downstream analyses and the interpretation of results, but is often not straightforward. To address this difficulty, we present singleCellHaystack, a method that enables the prediction of DEGs without relying on explicit clustering of cells. Our method uses Kullback\textendash Leibler divergence to find genes that are expressed in subsets of cells that are non-randomly positioned in a multidimensional space. Comparisons with existing DEG prediction approaches on artificial datasets show that singleCellHaystack has higher accuracy. We illustrate the usage of singleCellHaystack through applications on 136 real transcriptome datasets and a spatial transcriptomics dataset. We demonstrate that our method is a fast and accurate approach for DEG prediction in single-cell data. singleCellHaystack is implemented as an R package and is available from CRAN and GitHub.},

Here we introduce a new data set of RNA elements in the human genome that are recognized by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), generated as part of the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project phase III. This class of regulatory elements functions only when transcribed into RNA, as they serve as the binding sites for RBPs that control post-transcriptional processes such as splicing, cleavage and polyadenylation, and the editing, localization, stability and translation of mRNAs. We describe the mapping and characterization of RNA elements recognized by a large collection of human RBPs in K562 and HepG2 cells. Integrative analyses using five assays identify RBP binding sites on RNA and chromatin in vivo, the in vitro binding preferences of RBPs, the function of RBP binding sites and the subcellular localization of RBPs, producing 1,223 replicated data sets for 356 RBPs. We describe the spectrum of RBP binding throughout the transcriptome and the connections between these interactions and various aspects of RNA biology, including RNA stability, splicing regulation and RNA localization. These data expand the catalogue of functional elements encoded in the human genome by the addition of a large set of elements that function at the RNA level by interacting with RBPs.},

  abstract = {Background: A critical step in uncovering rules of RNA processing is to study the in vivo regulatory networks of RNA binding proteins (RBPs). Crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) methods enable mapping RBP targets transcriptome-wide, but methodological differences present challenges to large-scale analysis across datasets. The development of enhanced CLIP (eCLIP) enabled the mapping of targets for 150 RBPs in K562 and HepG2, creating a unique resource of RBP interactomes profiled with a standardized methodology in the same cell types. Results: Our analysis of 223 eCLIP datasets reveals a range of binding modalities, including highly resolved positioning around splicing signals and mRNA untranslated regions that associate with distinct RBP functions. Quantification of enrichment for repetitive and abundant multicopy elements reveals 70\% of RBPs have enrichment for non-mRNA element classes, enables identification of novel ribosomal RNA processing factors and sites, and suggests that association with retrotransposable elements reflects multiple RBP mechanisms of action. Analysis of spliceosomal RBPs indicates that eCLIP resolves AQR association after intronic lariat formation, enabling identification of branch points with single-nucleotide resolution, and provides genome-wide validation for a branch point-based scanning model for 3{${'}$} splice site recognition. Finally, we show that eCLIP peak co-occurrences across RBPs enable the discovery of novel co-interacting RBPs. Conclusions: This work reveals novel insights into RNA biology by integrated analysis of eCLIP profiling of 150 RBPs with distinct functions. Further, our quantification of both mRNA and other element association will enable further research to identify novel roles of RBPs in regulating RNA processing.},

A major critical challenge for this class of experiments is the problem of image segmentation, or determining which parts of a microscope image correspond to which individual cells. Current approaches require many hours of manual curation and depend on approaches that are difficult to share between labs. They are also unable to robustly segment the cytoplasms of mammalian cells. Here, we show that deep convolutional neural networks, a supervised machine learning method, can solve this challenge for multiple cell types across the domains of life. We demonstrate that this approach can robustly segment fluorescent images of cell nuclei as well as phase images of the cytoplasms of individual bacterial and mammalian cells from phase contrast images without the need for a fluorescent cytoplasmic marker. These networks also enable the simultaneous segmentation and identification of different mammalian cell types grown in co-culture. A quantitative comparison with prior methods demonstrates that convolutional neural networks have improved accuracy and lead to a significant reduction in curation time. We relay our experience in designing and optimizing deep convolutional neural networks for this task and outline several design rules that we found led to robust performance. We conclude that deep convolutional neural networks are an accurate method that require less curation time, are generalizable to a multiplicity of cell types, from bacteria to mammalian cells, and expand live-cell imaging capabilities to include multi-cell type systems.},

  abstract = {During early human pregnancy the uterine mucosa transforms into the decidua, into which the fetal placenta implants and where placental trophoblast cells intermingle and communicate with maternal cells. Trophoblast-decidual interactions underlie common diseases of pregnancy, including pre-eclampsia and stillbirth. Here we profile the transcriptomes of about 70,000 single cells from first-trimester placentas with matched maternal blood and decidual cells. The cellular composition of human decidua reveals subsets of perivascular and stromal cells that are located in distinct decidual layers. There are three major subsets of decidual natural killer cells that have distinctive immunomodulatory and chemokine profiles. We develop a repository of ligand-receptor complexes and a statistical tool to predict the cell-type specificity of cell-cell communication via these molecular interactions. Our data identify many regulatory interactions that prevent harmful innate or adaptive immune responses in this environment. Our single-cell atlas of the maternal-fetal interface reveals the cellular organization of the decidua and placenta, and the interactions that are critical for placentation and reproductive success.},

Here we reduced this complexity by focusing on cellular organization\textemdash a key readout and driver of cell behaviour               3,4               \textemdash at the level of major cellular structures that represent distinct organelles and functional machines, and generated the WTC-11 hiPSC Single-Cell Image Dataset v1, which contains more than 200,000 live cells in 3D, spanning 25 key cellular structures. The scale and quality of this dataset permitted the creation of a generalizable analysis framework to convert raw image data of cells and their structures into dimensionally reduced, quantitative measurements that can be interpreted by humans, and to facilitate data exploration. This framework embraces the vast cell-to-cell variability that is observed within a normal population, facilitates the integration of cell-by-cell structural data and allows quantitative analyses of distinct, separable aspects of organization within and across different cell populations. We found that the integrated intracellular organization of interphase cells was robust to the wide range of variation in cell shape in the population; that the average locations of some structures became polarized in cells at the edges of colonies while maintaining the `wiring' of their interactions with other structures; and that, by contrast, changes in the location of structures during early mitotic reorganization were accompanied by changes in their wiring.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Because of its non-destructive nature, label-free imaging is an important strategy for studying biological processes. However, routine microscopic techniques like phase contrast or DIC suffer from shadow-cast artifacts making automatic segmentation challenging. The aim of this study was to compare the segmentation efficacy of published steps of segmentation work-flow (image reconstruction, foreground segmentation, cell detection (seed-point extraction) and cell (instance) segmentation) on a dataset of the same cells from multiple contrast microscopic modalities. RESULTS: We built a collection of routines aimed at image segmentation of viable adherent cells grown on the culture dish acquired by phase contrast, differential interference contrast, Hoffman modulation contrast and quantitative phase imaging, and we performed a comprehensive comparison of available segmentation methods applicable for label-free data. We demonstrated that it is crucial to perform the image reconstruction step, enabling the use of segmentation methods originally not applicable on label-free images. Further we compared foreground segmentation methods (thresholding, feature-extraction, level-set, graph-cut, learning-based), seed-point extraction methods (Laplacian of Gaussians, radial symmetry and distance transform, iterative radial voting, maximally stable extremal region and learning-based) and single cell segmentation methods. We validated suitable set of methods for each microscopy modality and published them online. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that image reconstruction step allows the use of segmentation methods not originally intended for label-free imaging. In addition to the comprehensive comparison of methods, raw and reconstructed annotated data and Matlab codes are provided.},

  abstract = {In Huntington's disease (HD), expansion of CAG codons in the huntingtin gene (HTT) leads to the aberrant formation of protein aggregates and the differential degeneration of striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs). Modeling HD using patient-specific MSNs has been challenging, as neurons differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells are free of aggregates and lack an overt cell death phenotype. Here we generated MSNs from HD patient fibroblasts through microRNA-based direct neuronal conversion, bypassing the induction of pluripotency and retaining age signatures of the original fibroblasts. We found that patient MSNs consistently exhibited mutant HTT (mHTT) aggregates, mHTT-dependent DNA damage, mitochondrial dysfunction and spontaneous degeneration in culture over time. We further provide evidence that erasure of age stored in starting fibroblasts or neuronal conversion of presymptomatic HD patient fibroblasts results in differential manifestation of cellular phenotypes associated with HD, highlighting the importance of age in modeling late-onset neurological disorders.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a machine learning approach for visual object detection which is capable of processing images extremely rapidly and achieving high detection rates. This work is distinguished by three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image representation called the ``integral image'' which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a learning algorithm, based on AdaBoost, which selects a small number of critical visual features from a larger set and yields extremely efficient classifiers. The third contribution is a method for combining increasingly more complex classifiers in a ``cascade'' which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising object-like regions. The cascade can be viewed as an object specific focus-of-attention mechanism which unlike previous approaches provides statistical guarantees that discarded regions are unlikely to contain the object of interest. In the domain of face detection the system yields detection rates comparable to the best previous systems. Used in real-time applications, the detector runs at 15 frames per second without resorting to image differencing or skin color detection.},

Statement of need                            Generating insight from high-dimensional data matrices typically works through training models that annotate observations and variables via low-dimensional representations. In exploratory data analysis, this involves               iterative               training and analysis using original and learned annotations and task-associated representations. anndata offers a canonical data structure for book-keeping these, which is neither addressed by pandas (McKinney, 2010), nor xarray (Hoyer \& Hamman, 2017), nor commonly-used modeling packages like scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011).},

  abstract = {Abstract                        Recent advancements in             in situ             methods, such as multiplexed             in situ             RNA hybridization and             in situ             RNA sequencing, have deepened our understanding of the way biological processes are spatially organized in tissues. Automated image processing and spot-calling algorithms for analyzing             in situ             transcriptomics images have many parameters which need to be tuned for optimal detection. Having ground truth datasets (images where there is very high confidence on the accuracy of the detected spots) is essential for evaluating these algorithms and tuning their parameters.                                   We present a first-in-kind open-source toolkit and framework for             in situ             transcriptomics image analysis that incorporates crowdsourced annotations, alongside expert annotations, as a source of ground truth for the analysis of             in situ             transcriptomics images. The kit includes tools for preparing images for crowdsourcing annotation to optimize crowdsourced workers' ability to annotate these images reliably, performing quality control (QC) on worker annotations, extracting candidate parameters for spot-calling algorithms from sample images, tuning parameters for spot-calling algorithms, and evaluating spot-calling algorithms and worker performance. These tools are wrapped in a modular pipeline with a flexible structure that allows users to take advantage of crowdsourced annotations from any source of their choice. We tested the pipeline using real and synthetic             in situ             transcriptomics images and annotations from the Amazon Mechanical Turk system obtained via Quanti.us. Using real images from             in situ             experiments and simulated images produced by one of the tools in the kit, we studied worker sensitivity to spot characteristics and established rules for annotation QC. We explored and demonstrated the use of ground truth generated in this way for validating spot-calling algorithms and tuning their parameters, and confirmed that consensus crowdsourced annotations are a viable substitute for expert-generated ground truth for these purposes.

However, while Illumina short-read sequencers can be used to analyze entire transcriptomes down to the level of individual splicing events with great accuracy, they fall short of analyzing how these individual events are combined into complete RNA transcript isoforms. Because of this shortfall, long-distance information is required to complement short-read sequencing to analyze transcriptomes on the level of full-length RNA transcript isoforms.

  abstract = {Single-cell genomics has now made it possible to create a comprehensive atlas of human cells. At the same time, it has reopened definitions of a cell's identity and of the ways in which identity is regulated by the cell's molecular circuitry.

  abstract = {Two major inconsistencies exist in the current neo-Darwinian evolutionary theory that random chromosomal mutations acted on by natural selection generate new species. First, natural selection does not require the evolution of ever increasing complexity, yet this is the hallmark of biology. Second, human chromosomal DNA sequence variation is predominantly either neutral or deleterious and is insufficient to provide the variation required for speciation or for predilection to common diseases. Complexity is explained by the continuous flow of energy through the biosphere that drives the accumulation of nucleic acids and information. Information then encodes complex forms. In animals, energy flow is primarily mediated by mitochondria whose maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) codes for key genes for energy metabolism. In mammals, the mtDNA has a very high mutation rate, but the deleterious mutations are removed by an ovarian selection system. Hence, new mutations that subtly alter energy metabolism are continuously introduced into the species, permitting adaptation to regional differences in energy environments. Therefore, the most phenotypically significant gene variants arise in the mtDNA, are regional, and permit animals to occupy peripheral energy environments where rarer nuclear DNA (nDNA) variants can accumulate, leading to speciation. The neutralist-selectionist debate is then a consequence of mammals having two different evolutionary strategies: a fast mtDNA strategy for intra-specific radiation and a slow nDNA strategy for speciation. Furthermore, the missing genetic variation for common human diseases is primarily mtDNA variation plus regional nDNA variants, both of which have been missed by large, inter-population association studies.},

  abstract = {Factor analysis is a widely-used method for dimensionality reduction of high-throughput datasets in molecular biology and has recently been adapted to spatial transcriptomics data. However, existing methods assume (count) matrices as input and are therefore not directly applicable to single-molecule resolved data, which increasingly arise for example from multiplexed fluorescence insitu hybridization or in-situ sequencing experiments. To address this, we here propose FISHFactor, a probabilistic model that combines the benefits of spatial, non-negative factor analysis with a Poisson point process likelihood to explicitly model and account for the nature of single-molecule resolved data. FISHFactor furthermore leverages principles of multi-modal factor analysis to enable dissecting the transcriptional heterogeneity between multiple groups of samples, such as different cells. Using simulated and real data, we show that our approach leads to improved estimates of the true spatial transcriptome landscape compared to existing methods that rely on aggregating information by spatial binning. Applied to a set of NIH/3T3 cells, FISHFactor identifies major subcellular expression patterns and accurately recovers known spatial gene clusters.},

Here we report an in-depth analysis of 15 diverse human tissue and cell line transcriptomes on the basis of deep sequencing of complementary DNA fragments, yielding a digital inventory of gene and mRNA isoform expression. Analyses in which sequence reads are mapped to exon-exon junctions indicated that 92-94\% of human genes undergo alternative splicing, 86\% with a minor isoform frequency of 15\% or more. Differences in isoform-specific read densities indicated that most alternative splicing and alternative cleavage and polyadenylation events vary between tissues, whereas variation between individuals was approximately twofold to threefold less common. Extreme or 'switch-like' regulation of splicing between tissues was associated with increased sequence conservation in regulatory regions and with generation of full-length open reading frames. Patterns of alternative splicing and alternative cleavage and polyadenylation were strongly correlated across tissues, suggesting coordinated regulation of these processes, and sequence conservation of a subset of known regulatory motifs in both alternative introns and 3' untranslated regions suggested common involvement of specific factors in tissue-level regulation of both splicing and polyadenylation.},

  abstract = {Structured Abstract INTRODUCTIONStrong genetic associations have been found for a number of psychiatric disorders. However, understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms remains challenging. RATIONALETo address this challenge, the PsychENCODE Consortium has developed a comprehensive online resource and integrative models for the functional genomics of the human brain. RESULTSThe base of the pyramidal resource is the datasets generated by PsychENCODE, including bulk transcriptome, chromatin, genotype, and Hi-C datasets and single-cell transcriptomic data from \textasciitilde 32,000 cells for major brain regions. We have merged these with data from Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx), ENCODE, Roadmap Epigenomics, and single-cell analyses. Via uniform processing, we created a harmonized resource, allowing us to survey functional genomics data on the brain over a sample size of 1866 individuals.From this uniformly processed dataset, we created derived data products. These include lists of brain-expressed genes, coexpression modules, and single-cell expression profiles for many brain cell types; \textasciitilde 79,000 brain-active enhancers with associated Hi-C loops and topologically associating domains; and \textasciitilde 2.5 million expression quantitative-trait loci (QTLs) comprising \textasciitilde 238,000 linkage-disequilibrium\textendash independent single-nucleotide polymorphisms and of other types of QTLs associated with splice isoforms, cell fractions, and chromatin activity. By using these, we found that {$>$}88\% of the cross-population variation in brain gene expression can be accounted for by cell fraction changes. Furthermore, a number of disorders and aging are associated with changes in cell-type proportions. The derived data also enable comparison between the brain and other tissues. In particular, by using spectral analyses, we found that the brain has distinct expression and epigenetic patterns, including a greater extent of noncoding transcription than other tissues.The top level of the resource consists of integrative networks for regulation and machine-learning models for disease prediction. The networks include a full gene regulatory network (GRN) for the brain, linking transcription factors, enhancers, and target genes from merging of the QTLs, generalized element-activity correlations, and Hi-C data. By using this network, we link disease genes to genome-wide association study (GWAS) variants for psychiatric disorders. For schizophrenia, we linked 321 genes to the 142 reported GWAS loci. We then embedded the regulatory network into a deep-learning model to predict psychiatric phenotypes from genotype and expression. Our model gives a \textasciitilde 6-fold improvement in prediction over additive polygenic risk scores. Moreover, it achieves a \textasciitilde 3-fold improvement over additive models, even when the gene expression data are imputed, highlighting the value of having just a small amount of transcriptome data for disease prediction. Lastly, it highlights key genes and pathways associated with disorder prediction, including immunological, synaptic, and metabolic pathways, recapitulating de novo results from more targeted analyses. CONCLUSIONOur resource and integrative analyses have uncovered genomic elements and networks in the brain, which in turn have provided insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying psychiatric disorders. Our deep-learning model improves disease risk prediction over traditional approaches and can be extended with additional data types (e.g., microRNA and neuroimaging). {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/362/6420/eaat8464/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint A comprehensive functional genomic resource for the adult human brain.The resource forms a three-layer pyramid. The bottom layer includes sequencing datasets for traits, such as schizophrenia. The middle layer represents derived datasets, including functional genomic elements and QTLs. The top layer contains integrated models, which link genotypes to phenotypes. DSPN, Deep Structured Phenotype Network; PC1 and PC2, principal components 1 and 2; ref, reference; alt, alternate; H3K27ac, histone H3 acetylation at lysine 27. Despite progress in defining genetic risk for psychiatric disorders, their molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Addressing this, the PsychENCODE Consortium has generated a comprehensive online resource for the adult brain across 1866 individuals. The PsychENCODE resource contains \textasciitilde 79,000 brain-active enhancers, sets of Hi-C linkages, and topologically associating domains; single-cell expression profiles for many cell types; expression quantitative-trait loci (QTLs); and further QTLs associated with chromatin, splicing, and cell-type proportions. Integration shows that varying cell-type proportions largely account for the cross-population variation in expression (with {$>$}88\% reconstruction accuracy). It also allows building of a gene regulatory network, linking genome-wide association study variants to genes (e.g., 321 for schizophrenia). We embed this network into an interpretable deep-learning model, which improves disease prediction by \textasciitilde 6-fold versus polygenic risk scores and identifies key genes and pathways in psychiatric disorders.},

RRIs are usually facilitated, stabilized, or mediated by RNA-binding proteins.

In addition, some chemical-based approaches are also powerful to detect RRIs globally based on the fact that RNA duplex can be cross-linked by psoralen or its derivative 40-aminomethyltrioxsalen. These efforts have significantly expanded our understanding of RRIs in determining the specificity and variability of gene regulation.

  abstract = {Significance             Alternative pre-mRNA splicing (AS) is a critical gene regulatory mechanism to produce diverse, tissue-specific, and functionally distinct protein profiles in eukaryotes to maintain normal cellular functions. Aberrant AS patterns are constantly associated with many human diseases, including cancer. The exceptional complexity of AS imposes a major challenge to analyzing AS across various tissues and cell types. Here we present a computational algorithm to profile and quantitate tissue-specific AS profiles from RNA-sequencing data without any prior knowledge of the host transcriptome. The junction usage model shows consistent superior performance in both specificity and sensitivity compared with other currently available AS analysis methods, and can be readily applied to a wide range of RNA samples from different organisms for accurate and comprehensive analyses of AS.           ,                             Alternative pre-mRNA splicing (AS) greatly diversifies metazoan transcriptomes and proteomes and is crucial for gene regulation. Current computational analysis methods of AS from Illumina RNA-sequencing data rely on preannotated libraries of known spliced transcripts, which hinders AS analysis with poorly annotated genomes and can further mask unknown AS patterns. To address this critical bioinformatics problem, we developed a method called the junction usage model (JUM) that uses a bottom-up approach to identify, analyze, and quantitate global AS profiles without any prior transcriptome annotations. JUM accurately reports global AS changes in terms of the five conventional AS patterns and an additional ``composite'' category composed of inseparable combinations of conventional patterns. JUM stringently classifies the difficult and disease-relevant pattern of intron retention (IR), reducing the false positive rate of IR detection commonly seen in other annotation-based methods to near-negligible rates.

  abstract = {Most existing point-based colocation methods are global measures (e.g., join count statistic, cross K function, and global colocation quotient). Most recently, a local indicator such as the local colocation quotient is proposed to capture the variability of colocation across areas. Our research advances this line of work by developing a simulation-based statistic test for the local indicator of colocation quotient (LCLQ). The study applies the indicator to examine the association of land use facilities with crime patterns. Moreover, we use the street network distance in addition to the traditional Euclidean distance in defining neighbors since human activities (including facilities and crimes) usually occur along a street network. The method is applied to analyze the colocation of three types of crimes and three categories of facilities in a city in Jiangsu Province, China. The findings demonstrate the value of the proposed method in colocation analysis of crime and facilities, and in general colocation analysis of point data.},

  abstract = {Transcriptome mapping in the 3D brain                            RNA sequencing samples the entire transcriptome but lacks anatomical information. In situ hybridization, on the other hand, can only profile a small number of transcripts. In situ sequencing technologies address these shortcomings but face a challenge in dense, complex tissue environments. Wang               et al.               combined an efficient sequencing approach with hydrogel-tissue chemistry to develop a multidisciplinary technology for three-dimensional (3D) intact-tissue RNA sequencing (see the Perspective by Kn\"opfel). More than 1000 genes were simultaneously mapped in sections of mouse brain at single-cell resolution to define cell types and circuit states and to reveal cell organization principles.

In situ transcriptomic methods can map both RNA quantity and position; however, it remains challenging to simultaneously satisfy key technological requirements such as efficiency, signal intensity, accuracy, scalability to large gene numbers, and applicability to three-dimensional (3D) volumes. Well-established single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) approaches (such as MERFISH and seqFISH) have high detection efficiency but require long RNA species (more than 1000 nucelotides) and yield lower intensity than that of enzymatic amplification methods (tens versus thousands of fluorophores per RNA molecule). Other pioneering in situ sequencing methods (via padlock probes and fluorescent in situ sequencing) use enzymatic amplification, thus achieving high intensity but with room to improve on efficiency.                                         RATIONALE               We have developed, validated, and applied STARmap (spatially-resolved transcript amplicon readout mapping). STARmap begins with labeling of cellular RNAs by pairs of DNA probes followed by enzymatic amplification so as to produce a DNA nanoball (amplicon), which eliminates background caused by mislabeling of single probes. Tissue can then be transformed into a 3D hydrogel DNA chip by anchoring DNA amplicons via an in situ\textendash synthesized polymer network and removing proteins and lipids. This form of hydrogel-tissue chemistry replots amplicons onto an optically transparent hydrogel coordinate system; then, to identify and quantify RNA species-abundance manifested by DNA amplicons, the identity of each species is encoded as a five-base barcode and read out by means of an in situ sequencing method that decodes DNA sequence in multicolor fluorescence. Using a new two-base sequencing scheme (SEDAL), STARmap was found to simultaneously detect more than 1000 genes over six imaging cycles, in which sequencing errors in any cycle cause misdecoding and are effectively rejected.                                         RESULTS               We began by (i) detecting and quantifying a focused 160-gene set (including cell type markers and activity-regulated genes) simultaneously in mouse primary visual cortex; (ii) clustering resulting per-cell gene expression patterns into a dozen distinct inhibitory, excitatory, and non-neuronal cell types; and (iii) mapping the spatial distribution of all of these cell types across layers of cortex. For validation, per-cell-type gene expression was found to correlate well both with in situ hybridization results and with single-cell RNA sequencing, and widespread up-regulation of activity-regulated genes was observed in response to visual stimulation. We next applied STARmap to a higher cognitive area (the medial prefrontal cortex) and discovered a more complex distribution of cell types. Last, we extended STARmap to much larger numbers of genes and spatial scales; we measured 1020 genes simultaneously in sections\textemdash obtaining results concordant with the 160-gene set\textemdash and measured 28 genes across millimeter-scale volumes encompassing \textasciitilde 30,000 cells, revealing 3D patterning principles that jointly characterize a broad and diverse spectrum of cell types.                                         CONCLUSION               STARmap combines hydrogel-tissue chemistry and in situ DNA sequencing to achieve intact-tissue single-cell measurement of expression of more than a thousand genes. In the future, combining this intact-system gene expression measurement with complementary cellular-resolution methodologies (with which STARmap is designed to be compatible)\textemdash including in vivo activity recording, optogenetic causal tests, and anatomical connectivity in the same cells\textemdash will help bridge molecular, cellular, and circuit scales of neuroscience.                                                   STARmap for 3D transcriptome imaging and molecular cell typing.                   STARmap is an in situ RNA-sequencing technology that transforms intact tissue into a 3D hydrogel-tissue hybrid and measures spatially resolved single-cell transcriptomes in situ. Error- and background-reduction mechanisms are implemented at multiple layers, enabling precise RNA quantification, spatially resolved cell typing, scalability to large gene numbers, and 3D mapping of tissue architecture.                                                                         ,              Retrieving high-content gene-expression information while retaining three-dimensional (3D) positional anatomy at cellular resolution has been difficult, limiting integrative understanding of structure and function in complex biological tissues.

  abstract = {Transcriptome mapping in the 3D brain                            RNA sequencing samples the entire transcriptome but lacks anatomical information. In situ hybridization, on the other hand, can only profile a small number of transcripts. In situ sequencing technologies address these shortcomings but face a challenge in dense, complex tissue environments. Wang               et al.               combined an efficient sequencing approach with hydrogel-tissue chemistry to develop a multidisciplinary technology for three-dimensional (3D) intact-tissue RNA sequencing (see the Perspective by Kn\"opfel). More than 1000 genes were simultaneously mapped in sections of mouse brain at single-cell resolution to define cell types and circuit states and to reveal cell organization principles.

In situ transcriptomic methods can map both RNA quantity and position; however, it remains challenging to simultaneously satisfy key technological requirements such as efficiency, signal intensity, accuracy, scalability to large gene numbers, and applicability to three-dimensional (3D) volumes. Well-established single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) approaches (such as MERFISH and seqFISH) have high detection efficiency but require long RNA species (more than 1000 nucelotides) and yield lower intensity than that of enzymatic amplification methods (tens versus thousands of fluorophores per RNA molecule). Other pioneering in situ sequencing methods (via padlock probes and fluorescent in situ sequencing) use enzymatic amplification, thus achieving high intensity but with room to improve on efficiency.                                         RATIONALE               We have developed, validated, and applied STARmap (spatially-resolved transcript amplicon readout mapping). STARmap begins with labeling of cellular RNAs by pairs of DNA probes followed by enzymatic amplification so as to produce a DNA nanoball (amplicon), which eliminates background caused by mislabeling of single probes. Tissue can then be transformed into a 3D hydrogel DNA chip by anchoring DNA amplicons via an in situ\textendash synthesized polymer network and removing proteins and lipids. This form of hydrogel-tissue chemistry replots amplicons onto an optically transparent hydrogel coordinate system; then, to identify and quantify RNA species-abundance manifested by DNA amplicons, the identity of each species is encoded as a five-base barcode and read out by means of an in situ sequencing method that decodes DNA sequence in multicolor fluorescence. Using a new two-base sequencing scheme (SEDAL), STARmap was found to simultaneously detect more than 1000 genes over six imaging cycles, in which sequencing errors in any cycle cause misdecoding and are effectively rejected.                                         RESULTS               We began by (i) detecting and quantifying a focused 160-gene set (including cell type markers and activity-regulated genes) simultaneously in mouse primary visual cortex; (ii) clustering resulting per-cell gene expression patterns into a dozen distinct inhibitory, excitatory, and non-neuronal cell types; and (iii) mapping the spatial distribution of all of these cell types across layers of cortex. For validation, per-cell-type gene expression was found to correlate well both with in situ hybridization results and with single-cell RNA sequencing, and widespread up-regulation of activity-regulated genes was observed in response to visual stimulation. We next applied STARmap to a higher cognitive area (the medial prefrontal cortex) and discovered a more complex distribution of cell types. Last, we extended STARmap to much larger numbers of genes and spatial scales; we measured 1020 genes simultaneously in sections\textemdash obtaining results concordant with the 160-gene set\textemdash and measured 28 genes across millimeter-scale volumes encompassing \textasciitilde 30,000 cells, revealing 3D patterning principles that jointly characterize a broad and diverse spectrum of cell types.                                         CONCLUSION               STARmap combines hydrogel-tissue chemistry and in situ DNA sequencing to achieve intact-tissue single-cell measurement of expression of more than a thousand genes. In the future, combining this intact-system gene expression measurement with complementary cellular-resolution methodologies (with which STARmap is designed to be compatible)\textemdash including in vivo activity recording, optogenetic causal tests, and anatomical connectivity in the same cells\textemdash will help bridge molecular, cellular, and circuit scales of neuroscience.                                                   STARmap for 3D transcriptome imaging and molecular cell typing.                   STARmap is an in situ RNA-sequencing technology that transforms intact tissue into a 3D hydrogel-tissue hybrid and measures spatially resolved single-cell transcriptomes in situ. Error- and background-reduction mechanisms are implemented at multiple layers, enabling precise RNA quantification, spatially resolved cell typing, scalability to large gene numbers, and 3D mapping of tissue architecture.                                                                         ,              Retrieving high-content gene-expression information while retaining three-dimensional (3D) positional anatomy at cellular resolution has been difficult, limiting integrative understanding of structure and function in complex biological tissues. We developed and applied a technology for 3D intact-tissue RNA sequencing, termed STARmap (spatially-resolved transcript amplicon readout mapping), which integrates hydrogel-tissue chemistry, targeted signal amplification, and in situ sequencing. The capabilities of STARmap were tested by mapping 160 to 1020 genes simultaneously in sections of mouse brain at single-cell resolution with high efficiency, accuracy, and reproducibility. Moving to thick tissue blocks, we observed a molecularly defined gradient distribution of excitatory-neuron subtypes across cubic millimeter\textendash scale volumes ({$>$}30,000 cells) and a short-range 3D self-clustering in many inhibitory-neuron subtypes that could be identified and described with 3D STARmap.},

  abstract = {RBM20 is a vertebrate-specific RNA-binding protein with two zinc finger (ZnF) domains, one RNA-recognition motif (RRM)-type RNA-binding domain and an arginine/serine (RS)-rich region. RBM20 has initially been identified as one of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)-linked genes. RBM20 is a regulator of heart-specific alternative splicing and Rbm20 {$\Delta$}RRM mice lacking the RRM domain are defective in the splicing regulation. The Rbm20 {$\Delta$}RRM mice, however, do not exhibit a characteristic DCM-like phenotype such as dilatation of left ventricles or systolic dysfunction. Considering that most of the RBM20 mutations identified in familial DCM cases were heterozygous missense mutations in an arginine-serine-arginine-serine-proline (RSRSP) stretch whose phosphorylation is crucial for nuclear localization of RBM20, characterization of a knock-in animal model is awaited. One of the major targets for RBM20 is the TTN gene, which is comprised of the largest number of exons in mammals. Alternative splicing of the TTN gene is exceptionally complicated and RBM20 represses {$>$}160 of its consecutive exons, yet detailed mechanisms for such extraordinary regulation are to be elucidated. The TTN gene encodes the largest known protein titin, a multi-functional sarcomeric structural protein specific to striated muscles. As titin is the most important factor for passive tension of cardiomyocytes, extensive heart-specific and developmentally regulated alternative splicing of the TTN pre-mRNA by RBM20 plays a critical role in passive stiffness and diastolic function of the heart. In disease models with diastolic dysfunctions, the phenotypes were rescued by increasing titin compliance through manipulation of the Ttn pre-mRNA splicing, raising RBM20 as a potential therapeutic target.},

  abstract = {Landmark-based geometric morphometrics is a powerful approach to quantifying biological shape, shape variation, and covariation of shape with other biotic or abiotic variables or factors. The resulting graphical representations of shape differences are visually appealing and intuitive. This paper serves as an introduction to common exploratory and confirmatory techniques in landmark-based geometric morphometrics. The issues most frequently faced by (paleo)biologists conducting studies of comparative morphology are covered. Acquisition of landmark and semilandmark data is discussed. There are several methods for superimposing landmark configurations, differing in how and in the degree to which among-configuration differences in location, scale, and size are removed. Partial Procrustes superimposition is the most widely used superimposition method and forms the basis for many subsequent operations in geometric morphometrics. Shape variation among superimposed configurations can be visualized as a scatter plot of landmark coordinates, as vectors of landmark displacement, as a thin-plate spline deformation grid, or through a principal components analysis of landmark coordinates or warp scores. The amount of difference in shape between two configurations can be quantified as the partial Procrustes distance; and shape variation within a sample can be quantified as the average partial Procrustes distance from the sample mean. Statistical testing of difference in mean shape between samples using warp scores as variables can be achieved through a standard Hotelling's T2 test, MANOVA, or canonical variates analysis (CVA). A nonparametric equivalent to MANOVA or Goodall's F-test can be used in analysis of Procrustes coordinates or Procrustes distance, respectively. CVA can also be used to determine the confidence with which a priori specimen classification is supported by shape data, and to assign unclassified specimens to pre-defined groups (assuming that the specimen actually belongs in one of the pre-defined groups). Examples involving Cambrian olenelloid trilobites are used to illustrate how the various techniques work and their practical application to data. Mathematical details of the techniques are provided as supplemental online material. A guide to conducting the analyses in the free Integrated Morphometrics Package software is provided in the appendix.},

  abstract = {RNA               binding proteins (               RBPs               ) play key roles in determining cellular behavior by manipulating the processing of target               RNAs               . Robust methods are required to detect the numerous binding sites of               RBPs               across the transcriptome.               RNA               -immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (               RIP               -seq) and crosslinking followed by immunoprecipitation and sequencing (               CLIP               -seq) are state-of-the-art methods used to identify the               RNA               targets and specific binding sites of               RBPs               . Historically,               CLIP               methods have been confounded with challenges such as the requirement for tens of millions of cells per experiment, low               RNA               yields resulting in libraries that contain a high number of polymerase chain reaction duplicated reads, and technical inconveniences such as radioactive labeling of               RNAs               . However, recent improvements in the recovery of bound               RNAs               and the efficiency of converting isolated               RNAs               into a library for sequencing have enhanced our ability to perform the experiment at scale, from less starting material than has previously been possible, and resulting in high quality datasets for the confident identification of protein binding sites. These, along with additional improvements to protein capture, removal of nonspecific signals, and methods to isolate noncanonical               RBP               targets have revolutionized the study of               RNA               processing regulation, and reveal a promising future for mapping the human protein-               RNA               regulatory network.

Here we analyze the in vivo movement of 16 Rab GTPases within Drosophila larval axons and show that HTT differentially influences the movement of a particular sub-set of these Rab-containing vesicles. While reduction of HTT perturbed the bi-directional motility of Rab3 and Rab19-containing vesicles, only the retrograde motility of Rab7-containing vesicles was disrupted with reduction of HTT. Interestingly, reduction of HTT stimulated the anterograde motility of Rab2-containing vesicles. Simultaneous dual-view imaging revealed that HTT and Rab2, 7 or 19 move together during axonal transport.

  abstract = {Single-cell transcriptomics (scRNA-seq) has become essential for biomedical research over the past decade, particu-larly in developmental biology, cancer, immunology, and neuroscience. Most commercially available scRNA-seq pro-tocols require cells to be recovered intact and viable from tissue. This has precluded many cell types from study and largely destroys the spatial context that could otherwise inform analyses of cell identity and function. An increasing number of commercially available platforms now facilitate spatially resolved, high-dimensional assessment of gene transcription, known as `spatial transcriptomics'. Here, we introduce different classes of method, which either record the locations of hybridized mRNA molecules in tissue, image the positions of cells themselves prior to assessment, or employ spatial arrays of mRNA probes of pre-determined location. We review sizes of tissue area that can be assessed, their spatial resolution, and the number and types of genes that can be profiled. We discuss if tissue preservation influences choice of platform, and provide guidance on whether specific platforms may be better suited to discovery screens or hypothesis testing. Finally, we introduce bioinformatic methods for analysing spatial transcriptomic data, including pre-processing, integration with existing scRNA-seq data, and inference of cell-cell interactions. Spatial -omics methods are already improving our understanding of human tissues in research, diagnostic, and therapeutic settings. To build upon these recent advancements, we provide entry-level guidance for those seeking to employ spatial transcriptomics in their own biomedical research.},

We show that our newly introduced multidimensional DTW concept requires significantly less decoding time while providing the same data fusion flexibility as the AHMM. Thus, it can be applied in a wide range of real-time multimodal classification tasks. Optimally exploiting mutual information during decoding even if the input streams are not synchronous, our algorithm outperforms late and early fusion techniques in a challenging bimodal speech and gesture fusion experiment.},

For example, modern ConvNets, represented by ConvNeXt [33], have demonstrated strong performance in various scenarios.

In this paper, we propose a fully convolutional masked autoencoder framework and a new Global Response Normalization (GRN) layer that can be added to the ConvNeXt architecture to enhance inter-channel feature competition. This co-design of self-supervised learning techniques and architectural improvement results in a new model family called ConvNeXt V2, which significantly improves the performance of pure ConvNets on various recognition benchmarks, including ImageNet classification, COCO detection, and ADE20K segmentation.

Despite progress towards more and more accurate contact maps, several systematic biases have been demonstrated to affect the resulting data matrix. Here we report a new source of bias that can arise in tumor Hi-C data, which is related to the copy number of genomic DNA. To address this bias, we designed a chromosome-adjusted iterative correction method called caICB. Our caICB correction method leads to significant improvements when compared with the original iterative correction in terms of eliminating copy number bias. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION The method is available at https://bitbucket.org/mthjwu/hicapp CONTACT: michor@jimmy.harvard.eduSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

In this paper, we extend the dynamic filter to a new convolution operation, named PointConv. PointConv can be applied on point clouds to build deep convolutional networks. We treat convolution kernels as nonlinear functions of the local coordinates of 3D points comprised of weight and density functions. With respect to a given point, the weight functions are learned with multi-layer perceptron networks and density functions through kernel density estimation. The most important contribution of this work is a novel reformulation proposed for efficiently computing the weight functions, which allowed us to dramatically scale up the network and significantly improve its performance. The learned convolution kernel can be used to compute translation-invariant and permutation-invariant convolution on any point set in the 3D space. Besides, PointConv can also be used as deconvolution operators to propagate features from a subsampled point cloud back to its original resolution. Experiments on ModelNet40, ShapeNet, and ScanNet show that deep convolutional neural networks built on PointConv are able to achieve state-of-the-art on challenging semantic segmentation benchmarks on 3D point clouds. Besides, our experiments converting CIFAR-10 into a point cloud showed that networks built on PointConv can match the performance of convolutional networks in 2D images of a similar structure.}

  abstract = {Cancer cell population exhibits great cellular heterogeneity, and single-cell morphology encodes metastatic potential.           ,              A central goal of precision medicine is to predict disease outcomes and design treatments based on multidimensional information from afflicted cells and tissues. Cell morphology is an emergent readout of the molecular underpinnings of a cell's functions and, thus, can be used as a method to define the functional state of an individual cell. We measured 216 features derived from cell and nucleus morphology for more than 30,000 breast cancer cells. We find that single cell\textendash derived clones (SCCs) established from the same parental cells exhibit distinct and heritable morphological traits associated with genomic (ploidy) and transcriptomic phenotypes. Using unsupervised clustering analysis, we find that the morphological classes of SCCs predict distinct tumorigenic and metastatic potentials in vivo using multiple mouse models of breast cancer. These findings lay the groundwork for using quantitative morpho-profiling in vitro as a potentially convenient and economical method for phenotyping function in cancer in vivo.},

  abstract = {Background: The ability of a cell to change shape is crucial for the proper function of many cellular processes, including cell migration. One type of cell migration, referred to as amoeboid motility, involves alternating cycles of morphological expansion and retraction. Traditionally, this process has been characterized by a number of parameters providing global information about shape changes, which are insufficient to distinguish phenotypes based on local pseudopodial activities that typify amoeboid motility. Results: We developed a method that automatically detects and characterizes pseudopodial behavior of cells. The method uses skeletonization, a technique from morphological image processing to reduce a shape into a series of connected lines. It involves a series of automatic algorithms including image segmentation, boundary smoothing, skeletonization and branch pruning, and takes into account the cell shape changes between successive frames to detect protrusion and retraction activities. In addition, the activities are clustered into different groups, each representing the protruding and retracting history of an individual pseudopod. Conclusions: We illustrate the algorithms on movies of chemotaxing Dictyostelium cells and show that our method makes it possible to capture the spatial and temporal dynamics as well as the stochastic features of the pseudopodial behavior. Thus, the method provides a powerful tool for investigating amoeboid motility.},

These effects were reproducible by exogenous hydrogen peroxide. The antioxidant melatonin (MLT) inhibited enzyme leakage and peroxidation in a concentration-dependent manner.

Abstract This study proposes a framework to investigate the roles of urban spaces in connecting social contacts (i.e., ``friends''). The framework is applied to a Call Detail Record (CDR) dataset collected in Singapore. First, a comparative analysis is performed to understand how friends share urban space differently from random people. Then, we derive two metrics to quantify the ``bonding'' and ``bridging'' capabilities of places in the city. The two metrics reflect the potential of a place in connecting friends and random people (e.g., chance encounters), respectively. Finally, we examine the temporal signature of the places' bonding capabilities, and associate the results with various types of Points of Interest (POIs). We find that: (1) friends are more likely to share urban space than random people, and they also share more locations; (2) a place could play different roles in connecting friends vs. random people, and the relationship (between bonding and bridging) varies depending on the time and type of a day (weekdays vs. weekends); (3) the temporal signature of bonding capability is strongly related to the semantics of a place; (4) certain POI types (e.g., shopping malls) tend to have a much higher impact on bonding capability than others (e.g., sports centers).},

  abstract = {Abstract             Allele-specific protein-RNA binding is an essential aspect that may reveal functional genetic variants (GVs) mediating post-transcriptional regulation. Recently, genome-wide detection of in vivo binding of RNA-binding proteins is greatly facilitated by the enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (eCLIP) method. We developed a new computational approach, called BEAPR, to identify allele-specific binding (ASB) events in eCLIP-Seq data. BEAPR takes into account crosslinking-induced sequence propensity and variations between replicated experiments. Using simulated and actual data, we show that BEAPR largely outperforms often-used count analysis methods. Importantly, BEAPR overcomes the inherent overdispersion problem of these methods. Complemented by experimental validations, we demonstrate that the application of BEAPR to ENCODE eCLIP-Seq data of 154 proteins helps to predict functional GVs that alter splicing or mRNA abundance. Moreover, many GVs with ASB patterns have known disease relevance. Overall, BEAPR is an effective method that helps to address the outstanding challenge of functional interpretation of GVs.},

We validate this approach by integrating single-cell RNA-seq and chromatin images to identify distinct sub-populations of human naive CD4+ T-cells that are poised for activation.

This trafficking is mediated by trans-acting RNA-binding proteins interacting with cis-regulatory elements called zipcodes. While new sequencing-based technologies allow the high-throughput identification of RNAs localized to specific subcellular compartments, the precise mechanisms at play, and their dependency on specific sequence elements, remain poorly understood. RESULTS: We introduce RNATracker, a novel deep neural network built to predict, from their sequence alone, the distributions of mRNA transcripts over a predefined set of subcellular compartments. RNATracker integrates several state-of-the-art deep learning techniques (e.g. CNN, LSTM and attention layers) and can make use of both sequence and secondary structure information. We report on a variety of evaluations showing RNATracker's strong predictive power, which is significantly superior to a variety of baseline predictors. Despite its complexity, several aspects of the model can be isolated to yield valuable, testable mechanistic hypotheses, and to locate candidate zipcode sequences within transcripts. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Code and data can be accessed at https://www.github.com/HarveyYan/RNATracker. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract = {Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an adult-onset motor neuron disease that has been associated with a diverse array of genetic changes. Prominent among these are mutations in RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) or repeat expansions that give rise to toxic RNA species. RBPs are additionally central components of pathologic aggregates that constitute a disease hallmark, suggesting that dysregulation of RNA metabolism underlies disease progression. In the context of neuronal physiology, transport of RNAs and localized RNA translation in axons are fundamental to neuronal survival and function. Several lines of evidence suggest that axonal RNA translation is a central process perturbed by various pathogenic events associated with ALS. Dysregulated translation of specific RNA groups could underlie feedback effects that connect and reinforce disease manifestations. Among such candidates are RNAs encoding proteins involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics. Further understanding of axonally dysregulated RNA targets and of the feedback mechanisms they induce could provide useful therapeutic insights.

  abstract = {We propose a framework for modeling sequence motifs based on the maximum entropy principle (MEP). We recommend approximating short sequence motif distributions with the maximum entropy distribution (MED) consistent with low-order marginal constraints estimated from available data, which may include dependencies between nonadjacent as well as adjacent positions. Many maximum entropy models (MEMs) are specified by simply changing the set of constraints. Such models can be utilized to discriminate between signals and decoys. Classification performance using different MEMs gives insight into the relative importance of dependencies between different positions. We apply our framework to large datasets of RNA splicing signals. Our best models out-perform previous probabilistic models in the discrimination of human 5 (donor) and 3 (acceptor) splice sites from decoys. Finally, we discuss mechanistically motivated ways of comparing models.},

  abstract = {We propose a framework for modeling sequence motifs based on the maximum entropy principle (MEP). We recommend approximating short sequence motif distributions with the maximum entropy distribution (MED) consistent with low-order marginal constraints estimated from available data, which may include dependencies between nonadjacent as well as adjacent positions. Many maximum entropy models (MEMs) are specified by simply changing the set of constraints. Such models can be utilized to discriminate between signals and decoys. Classification performance using different MEMs gives insight into the relative importance of dependencies between different positions. We apply our framework to large datasets of RNA splicing signals. Our best models out-perform previous probabilistic models in the discrimination of human 5' (donor) and 3' (acceptor) splice sites from decoys. Finally, we discuss mechanistically motivated ways of comparing models.},

  abstract = {We consider the problem of explaining the predictions of graph neural networks (GNNs), which otherwise are considered as black boxes. Existing methods invariably focus on explaining the importance of graph nodes or edges but ignore the substructures of graphs, which are more intuitive and human-intelligible. In this work, we propose a novel method, known as SubgraphX, to explain GNNs by identifying important subgraphs. Given a trained GNN model and an input graph, our SubgraphX explains its predictions by efficiently exploring different subgraphs with Monte Carlo tree search. To make the tree search more effective, we propose to use Shapley values as a measure of subgraph importance, which can also capture the interactions among different subgraphs. To expedite computations, we propose efficient approximation schemes to compute Shapley values for graph data. Our work represents the first attempt to explain GNNs via identifying subgraphs explicitly and directly. Experimental results show that our SubgraphX achieves significantly improved explanations, while keeping computations at a reasonable level.},

The availability of high-throughput spatial expression data opens the door to methods that can infer such interactions both within and between cells. To achieve this, we developed Graph Convolutional Neural networks for Genes (GCNG). GCNG encodes the spatial information as a graph and combines it with expression data using supervised training. GCNG improves upon prior methods used to analyze spatial transcriptomics data and can propose novel pairs of extracellular interacting genes. The output of GCNG can also be used for downstream analysis including functional gene assignment. Supporting website with software and data: https://github.com/xiaoyeye/GCNG.},

  abstract = {Identifying binding targets of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) can greatly facilitate our understanding of their functional mechanisms. Most computational methods employ machine learning to train classifiers on either RBP-specific targets or pooled RBP-RNA interactions. The former strategy is more powerful, but it only applies to a few RBPs with a large number of known targets; conversely, the latter strategy sacrifices prediction accuracy for a wider application, since specific interaction features are inevitably obscured through pooling heterogeneous datasets. Here, we present beRBP, a dual approach to predict human RBP-RNA interaction given PWM of a RBP and one RNA sequence. Based on Random Forests, beRBP not only builds a specific model for each RBP with a decent number of known targets, but also develops a general model for RBPs with limited or null known targets. The specific and general models both compared well with existing methods on three benchmark datasets. Notably, the general model achieved a better performance than existing methods on most novel RBPs. Overall, as a composite solution overarching the RBP-specific and RBP-General strategies, beRBP is a promising tool for human RBP binding estimation with good prediction accuracy and a broad application scope.},

Here, we have developed an analytic framework, named PRADA, that identifies oncogenic RNA-binding proteins through the systematic detection of coordinated changes in their target regulons. Application of this approach to data collected from clinical samples, patient-derived xenografts, and cell line models of colon cancer metastasis revealed the RNA-binding protein RBMS1 as a suppressor of colon cancer progression. We observed that silencing RBMS1 results in increased metastatic capacity in xenograft mouse models, and that restoring its expression blunts metastatic liver colonization. We have found that RBMS1 functions as a posttranscriptional regulator of RNA stability by directly binding its target mRNAs. Together, our findings establish a role for RBMS1 as a previously unknown regulator of RNA stability and as a suppressor of colon cancer metastasis with clinical utility for risk stratification of patients.                                         Significance:               By applying a new analytic approach to transcriptomic data from clinical samples and models of colon cancer progression, we have identified RBMS1 as a suppressor of metastasis and as a post-transcriptional regulator of RNA stability. Notably, RBMS1 silencing and downregulation of its targets are negatively associated with patient survival.               See related commentary by Carter, p. 1261.

Here, we separated cytosolic and nuclear RNA from human fetal and adult brain samples and performed a comprehensive analysis of cytosolic and nuclear transcriptomes. There are significant differences in RNA expression for protein-coding and lncRNA genes between cytosol and nucleus. We show that transcripts encoding the nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins are significantly enriched in the cytosol compared to the rest of protein-coding genes. Differential expression analysis between fetal and adult frontal cortex show that results obtained from the cytosolic RNA differ from results using nuclear RNA both at the level of transcript types and the number of differentially expressed genes. Our data provide a resource for the subcellular localization of thousands of RNA transcripts in the human brain and highlight differences in using the cytosolic or the nuclear transcriptomes for expression analysis.},

  abstract = {The precise control of messenger RNA (mRNA) translation is a crucial step in posttranscriptional gene regulation of cellular physiology. However, it remains a challenge to systematically study mRNA translation at the transcriptomic scale with spatial and single-cell resolution. Here, we report the development of ribosome-bound mRNA mapping (RIBOmap), a highly multiplexed three-dimensional in situ profiling method to detect cellular translatome. RIBOmap profiling of 981 genes in HeLa cells revealed cell cycle\textendash dependent translational control and colocalized translation of functional gene modules. We mapped 5413 genes in mouse brain tissues, yielding spatially resolved single-cell translatomic profiles for 119,173 cells and revealing cell type\textendash specific and brain region\textendash specific translational regulation, including translation remodeling during oligodendrocyte maturation. Our method detected widespread patterns of localized translation in neuronal and glial cells in intact brain tissue networks.           ,              Editor's summary                            A long-held goal of biological research is to measure protein translation with spatially resolved, single-cell resolution. Existing methods such as ribosome profiling measure protein translation as an average of many cells and lack spatial resolution. Zeng               et al               . developed a highly multiplexed, ribosome-bound messenger RNA imaging technique called RIBOmap and applied it in single cells in situ to profile translation events with spatial coordinates (see the Perspective by Fan). Thousands of genes were simultaneously mapped in intact cells and tissues at molecular resolution, revealing the regulatory principles that specify the location and efficiency of protein production for functionally relevant gene programs across different cell types and tissue regions. \textemdash Di Jiang                        ,              RIBOmap enables single-cell in situ profiling of mRNA translation in 3D for thousands of genes in intact cells and tissues.           ,                             INTRODUCTION               Cellular proteins are the final products of gene expression that execute cellular functions. To understand translational gene regulation, it is crucial to measure protein synthesis at single-cell and spatial resolution. Current ribosome profiling methods achieve transcriptome-wide translational analysis but lack spatial context. By contrast, imaging-based methods preserve spatial information but are not multiplexed. A scalable method for single-cell and spatially resolved profiling of protein synthesis is still needed.                                         RATIONALE               We introduce ribosome-bound mRNA mapping (RIBOmap), a highly multiplexed method for spatial charting of protein synthesis at single-cell and subcellular resolution. RIBOmap employs a targeted-sequencing strategy that selectively detects ribosome-bound mRNAs through a specific design of tri-probes. The tri-probe set consists of a splint DNA probe hybridized to ribosomal RNA and a pair of padlock and primer probes hybridized to mRNAs, which together produce DNA amplicons with gene-unique barcodes through in situ amplification. These DNA amplicons are then embedded in a polyacrylamide hydrogel matrix and the gene-unique barcodes are read out through in situ sequencing. We validated the specificity of RIBOmap through the use of noncoding RNAs, translation inhibitor, in vitro transcribed mRNAs, and comparison with established ribosome profiling technology.                                         RESULTS               We applied RIBOmap to HeLa cells for a 981-gene multiplexed experiment and designed a multimodal RIBOmap imaging experiment to capture the cell-cycle phase and subcellular organelles. The results revealed cell-cycle\textendash dependent translation and subcellular localized mRNA translation in HeLa cells. We further applied RIBOmap to intact mouse brain tissue, measuring the translation of 5413 genes simultaneously. Leveraging the single-cell and spatial resolutions of RIBOmap, we generated a single-cell spatial map of the mouse brain. By comparing the spatial translatomics generated by RIBOmap with spatial transcriptomics, we uncovered cell type\textendash specific and brain region\textendash specific translational regulation.                                         CONCLUSION               RIBOmap presents a new spatially resolved single-cell translatomics technology, accelerating our understanding of protein synthesis in the context of subcellular architecture, cell types, and tissue anatomy. The pairwise spatial translatomic and transcriptomic mapping enabled us to systematically identify cell type- and tissue-region\textendash specific translational regulation, paving the way for uncovering novel posttranscriptional gene regulation principles and mechanisms that shape the proteome for cellular and tissue functions. RIBOmap bypasses complicated polysome isolation steps and genetic manipulation, making it promising for studies in post hoc human tissue and disease samples. We anticipate that integrating RIBOmap with other imaging-based measurements will enable spatial multiomics mapping for a comprehensive understanding of biological systems.                                                   RIBOmap for spatial translatomics imaging.                   RIBOmap is a three-dimensional (3D) in situ profiling technology designed to selectively measure ribosome-bound mRNAs, providing spatially resolved single-cell translatome analysis at molecular resolution. In cell culture, RIBOmap uncovers cell-cycle-dependent and subcellular localized translation. When applied to intact mouse brain tissue, RIBOmap generates spatial tissue atlases and reveals cell-type\textendash specific and tissue region\textendash specific translational regulation.},

  abstract = {Neighborhood aggregation is a key step in Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) for graph representation learning. Two commonly used aggregators, sum and mean, are designed with the homophily assumption that connected nodes are likely to share the same label. However, real-world graphs are noisy and adjacent nodes do not necessarily imply similarity. Learnable aggregators are proposed in Graph Attention Network (GAT) and Learnable Graph Convolutional Layer (LGCL). However, GAT considers node importance but not the importance of different features. The convolution aggregator in LGCL considers feature importance but it can not directly operate on graphs due to the irregular connectivity and lack of orderliness. In this paper, we firstly unify the current learnable aggregators in a framework: Learnable Aggregator for GCN (LA-GCN) by introducing a shared auxiliary model that provides a customized schema in neighborhood aggregation. Under this framework, we propose a new model called LA-GCNMask consisting of a new aggregator function, mask aggregator. The auxiliary model learns a specific mask for each neighbor of a given node, allowing both node-level and feature-level attention. This mechanism learns to assign different importance to both nodes and features for prediction, which provides interpretable explanations for prediction and increases the model robustness. Experiments on seven graphs for node classification and graph classification tasks show that LA-GCNMask outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, our aggregator can identify both the important nodes and node features simultaneously, which provides a quantified understanding of the relationship between input nodes and the prediction. We further conduct experiments on noisy graphs to evaluate the robustness of our model. Experiments show that LA-GCNMask consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, with up to 15\% improvements in terms of accuracy compared to the second best.},

However, cell type identification remains a major challenge in imaging analysis, with most existing methods involving substantial manual assessment and subjective decisions for thousands of cells. We propose a novel machine learning algorithm, CELESTA, which uses both cell's protein expression and spatial information to identify cell type of individual cells. We demonstrate the performance of CELESTA on multiplexed immunofluorescence             in situ             images of colorectal cancer and head and neck cancer. Using the cell types identified by CELESTA, we identify tissue architecture associated with lymph node metastasis in HNSCC, which we validate in an independent cohort. By coupling our             in situ             spatial analysis with single-cell RNA-sequencing data on proximal sections of the same tissue specimens, we identify and validate cell-cell crosstalk associated with lymph node metastasis, demonstrating the power of spatial biology to reveal clinically-relevant cellular interactions.},

  abstract = {Recently developed spatial gene expression technologies such as the Spatial Transcriptomics and Visium platforms allow for comprehensive measurement of transcriptomic profiles while retaining spatial context. However, existing methods for analyzing spatial gene expression data often do not efficiently leverage the spatial information and fail to address the limited resolution of the technology. Here, we introduce BayesSpace, a fully Bayesian statistical method for clustering analysis and resolution enhancement of spatial transcriptomics data that seamlessly integrates into current transcriptomics analysis workflows. We show that BayesSpace improves the identification of transcriptionally distinct tissues from spatial transcriptomics samples of the brain, of melanoma, and of squamous cell carcinoma. In particular, BayesSpace's improved resolution allows the identification of tissue structure that is not detectable at the original resolution and thus not recovered by other methods. Using an in silico dataset constructed from scRNA-seq, we demonstrate that BayesSpace can spatially resolve expression patterns to near single-cell resolution without the need for external single-cell sequencing data. In all, our results illustrate the utility BayesSpace has in facilitating the discovery of biological insights from a variety of spatial transcriptomics datasets.},

  abstract = {Key challenges for human genetics, precision medicine and evolutionary biology include deciphering the regulatory code of gene expression and understanding the transcriptional effects of genome variation. However, this is extremely difficult because of the enormous scale of the noncoding mutation space. We developed a deep learning-based framework, ExPecto, that can accurately predict, ab initio from a DNA sequence, the tissue-specific transcriptional effects of mutations, including those that are rare or that have not been observed. We prioritized causal variants within disease- or trait-associated loci from all publicly available genome-wide association studies and experimentally validated predictions for four immune-related diseases. By exploiting the scalability of ExPecto, we characterized the regulatory mutation space for human RNA polymerase II-transcribed genes by in silico saturation mutagenesis and profiled {$>$} 140 million promoter-proximal mutations. This enables probing of evolutionary constraints on gene expression and ab initio prediction of mutation disease effects, making ExPecto an end-to-end computational framework for the in silico prediction of expression and disease risk.},

Colocation mining results are typically presented in a textual form and do not provide any spatial information; thus, the results lack an intuitive approach to obtain cognition of colocation rules. Here, we propose a visualization approach to discover colocation patterns for two independent point distributions and generate visual results. This approach makes use of the ability of human color perception. For two geographic features, our approach first generates density surfaces of the input features and then visualizes the density surfaces using a red or green light with different intensities. Then, based on the law of additive color mixing, our approach mixes the colors of the two density surfaces to generate a colocation rule map. The visualization approach can also provide local details of colocation and be used for local colocation analysis. Users can detect colocation patterns and their distribution from the colocation rule maps. We use both synthetic data and real data to test the performance of our approach.},

  abstract = {Background: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is an increasingly popular platform to study heterogeneity at the single cell level. Computational methods to process scRNA-seq have limited accessibility to bench scientists, as they require significant amount of bioinformatics skills. Results: We have developed Granatum, a web browser based scRNAseq analysis pipeline to make analysis more broadly accessible to researchers. Without a single line of programming code, a user can click through the pipeline, setting parameters and visualizing results via the interactive graphical interface. The pipeline conveniently walks the users through various steps of scRNA-seq analysis. It has a comprehensive list of modules, including plate merging and batch effect removal, outlier sample removal, gene filtering, gene expression normalization, cell clustering, differential gene expression analysis, pathway/ontology enrichment analysis, protein network interaction visualization, and pseudo-time cell series construction. Conclusions: Granatum enables much widely adoption of scRNA-seq technology by empowering the bench scientists with an easy to use graphical interface for scRNA-seq data analysis. The code is freely available for research use at: http://garmiregroup.org/granatum/code},

  abstract = {How intrinsic gene-regulatory networks interact with a cell's spatial environment to define its identity remains poorly understood. We developed an approach to distinguish between intrinsic and extrinsic effects on global gene expression by integrating analysis of sequencing-based and imaging-based single-cell transcriptomic profiles, using cross-platform cell type mapping combined with a hidden Markov random field model. We applied this approach to dissect the cell-type- and spatial-domain-associated heterogeneity in the mouse visual cortex region. Our analysis identified distinct spatially associated, cell-type-independent signatures in the glutamatergic and astrocyte cell compartments. Using these signatures to analyze single-cell RNA sequencing data, we identified previously unknown spatially associated subpopulations, which were validated by comparison with anatomical structures and Allen Brain Atlas images.},

Splicing efficiency emerged as the main predictive factor, explaining up to a third of the variability in localization. Combination with other features allowed predictive models that could explain up to 45\% of the variance for protein-coding genes and up to 34\% for lncRNAs. Factors associated with localization were similar between lncRNAs and mRNAs with some important differences. Readily accessible features can thus be used to predict RNA localization.},
